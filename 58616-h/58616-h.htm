I.</h2>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Valley of Achor</i>, <i>Aug.</i>
10, 1818.</p>
<p>To Mr. K&mdash;<span class="GutSmall">G</span>.</p>
<p><span class="GutSmall">DEAR SIR</span>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Many</span> thanks for the loan of the
invaluable books, containing the last fragments of the late
venerable and spiritual <span class="smcap">Jenkins</span>, of
Lewes.&mdash;Surely it may be said with propriety, &ldquo;He
being dead yet speaketh,&rdquo; but it is only to those who are
taught of God.&nbsp; We speak, says the Apostle, to wise men, not
to unhumbled, unrenewed, carnal men, nor to mere nominal
professors, nor to those who are barely resting in a form of
words, tho&rsquo; sound&mdash;such persons cannot digest the
experimental truths they contain; there was a time once when they
would not suit me, but I have found them exceedingly precious;
nor do I think that tried man had a sensation, a trial, a grief,
a temptation, an enemy, a sin, a corruption, a fear, a doubt, or
misgiving, but what the Lord has permitted me to feel; nor do I
think he was favored me with one token or pleasing hope, an help,
a deliverance, a gracious smile, or a display of the divine
faithfulness, in the application and fulfilment of the promises,
but the Lord has also indulged me with similar mercies.&nbsp; I
must recommend them to the poor of Christ&rsquo;s flock <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>who wait on and
for the Lord, till pardoning mercy is revealed with some
power.&mdash;I know you are anxious to learn how I go on in soul
matters, this is the main concern with you and with all my real
friends in Christ.&nbsp; I have now no other way left to inform
you satisfactorily, but by letter, and I certainly could fill
volumes on the subject of my daily experience of the teachings of
the ever blessed Spirit; nor have I any objection to make this
subject known to you, and to all those who are concerned for my
best interest: this is the principal point, to exalt the Lord
Jesus, in the grand displays of <i>his</i> grace to the most
unworthy&mdash;and I can say to <i>his</i> glory, <i>he</i> has,
I trusts most effectually humbled me in the dust, laid me low,
shewed me such views of sin as I never saw before, and quickened
my soul to feel what it never so sensibly and deeply felt
before.&nbsp; I do experience that the tendency of <i>his</i>
gracious influences meeken, soften, and humble the heart;
rendering it also teachable and grateful.&nbsp; This I could
demonstrate by reciting a variety of experiences I have been
favored with, but I pass by numbers, to relate one in particular,
that I can never forget in this and a coming world.</p>
<p>After I had been in this furnace some weeks, in which I felt
as others do in similar cases, much grief, anger, rebellion, and
discontent, but not quite without a spirit of prayer, that I
might be favored with the very gracious visits of the Saviour,
and a sense of God&rsquo;s approbation in my own soul, though
despised by others.&nbsp; I entreated the Lord to shew me the
exceeding sinfulness of sin, as well as I could bear it, for I am
convinced no man could ever behold sin in all its malignity, none
but the God-Man could bear <a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>that&mdash;yet I desired to see sin as
most abominable in God&rsquo;s sight.&nbsp; These petitions were
in time answered; the Lord led me to reflect deeply in my retired
moments, on the nature of sin, original and actual.&mdash;This
knowledge of it increased, till one evening, being alone, I was
most completely overpowered with a solemn stillness of spirit, a
view of sin, my own sins of heart, lip, and life; these crouded
in my mind.&nbsp; I felt guilty.&nbsp; I stood condemned.&nbsp; I
had a fearful apprehension of God&rsquo;s just displeasure; all
was dark within, except sin and the anger of God&mdash;these were
clear enough; horror overwhelmed me, and I sunk low at the
footstool of divine mercy; I feared, I trembled, I was brought
low, I was troubled.&nbsp; I saw nothing of a Saviour, though I
had so often preached about him.&nbsp; Head notions were nothing
now&mdash;past experience was hid, and every gracious promise of
the Bible was closed up for a time.&nbsp; What a state to be
in!&nbsp; But I believe this was drinking of the bitter cup our
Saviour drank so deeply: this was, in one sense, being crucified
with Christ, and having fellowship with him in his
sufferings.&nbsp; These feelings will give a man a real
understanding of all those texts which refer to soul trouble, in
the book of Job, the Psalms of David, the feelings of Jeremiah,
and perhaps, what Paul felt during the three days he was without
sight, and did neither eat nor drink.&nbsp; These feelings will
make me sympathize with the soul that is afflicted, and
experiences the terrors of the Almighty.</p>
<p>But I do esteem it among my many special favors, that this did
not continue but part of a night.&nbsp; I sank down in shame and
guilt, condemning myself and acknowledging the justice of God in
my condemnation.&nbsp; <a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>But while in this state, thus broken,
contrite, and filled with holy awe, I was kept pleading for
mercy, present mercy as well as future.&nbsp; While on my knees
prostrate, as Elijah on another occasion, or, as Jeremiah words
it, Putting my mouth in the dust; and although I really was
filled with fear lest I should be cut off, yet at this very time
the Lord gently led my mind, or rather brought the following
words, very softly to my heart; they were at first seemingly at a
distance, but drew nearer at I listened and observed them.&nbsp;
The words were, &ldquo;I have caused thine iniquities to pass
from thee, and have clothed thee with change of
raiment.&rdquo;&nbsp; I observed, my mind could not gladly
receive this sentence, fearing presumption&mdash;but they still
followed me, and abode with me, till the horror, terror, fears,
and darkness gradually dispersed, and my mind was enabled so far
to receive them as to cause a present ease, which continued with
me a few days longer.&nbsp; I found the peace they brought with
them continue, and I was in a small degree helped to believe they
were from God to me, and as much mine as they were
Joshua&rsquo;s, to whom they were spoken; but though my thoughts
were in a measure fixed upon them, yet I was not without being
assaulted with some misgivings of heart.&nbsp; I concluded it
best to entreat the Lord to shew me this more powerfully, and not
only to put the words in my mind, but to write them so
effectually that I might know, without the shadow of a doubt, I
was actually interested in the capital blessings the words
contained.&nbsp; This was most divinely manifested in a few days
afterwards, as I was in the act of reading some remarks of the
truly excellent Mr. <span class="smcap">Toplady</span>, on
Justification by the imparted Righteousness of the adorable
God-Man.&nbsp; I <a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>was actually overcome with a sweet surprize of the love
of God to me in Christ Jesus, making his dear Son a sin offering,
and his people righteousness in him.&nbsp; I was enabled to feel
such solid peace, holy joy, and sacred pleasure in my soul as can
never be described by tongue or pen.&nbsp; I was melted by the
power of his love, and indulged with such access to God, that
every doubt, fear, and misgiving of heart was removed.&nbsp; I
saw, I knew, I felt that I was reconciled to God, and that God
was my Father, my Saviour, and my Comforter.&mdash;Oh, that I had
then sunk into the arms of death!&nbsp; O that I had been
permitted to take my flight; at that time the Saviour had engaged
my heart, nor could I then have sinned against him for the
world.&nbsp; I want many such sweet manifestations of his
sensible presence; and I can assure you, painful as my situation
is, I would gladly endure it again for such enjoyments.&nbsp; But
I must observe, these blessed seasons are unknown to carnal
professors, and never enjoyed, even by the favorites of heaven
while in a light, careless, carnal frame of soul; no&mdash;the
promise runs thus, &ldquo;To this man will I look, (and surely it
was a look of love which I experienced) and with him will I
dwell, who is poor and of a contrite heart, and that trembles at
my word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Knowing you can rejoice in my prosperity, having mourned in my
adversity, I write thus freely.&mdash;Do as you please with the
letter; if it is of any consolation to your spiritual
acquaintances, let them read it likewise, but let them remember,
I do not send it to gain applause, but that they may glorify God
on my behalf.&nbsp; And as to many others, I am very sorry I ever
had their good opinion at all.</p>
<p><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>I must
just remark, that such blessed sensations as I have here
described, is not believing, but rather the end of our faith, the
present salvation of the soul.&nbsp; It is a manifestation of
pardoning mercy, as an evidence of full and free justification in
Christ&mdash;this is, in the best of senses, obtaining mercy; as
such, I shall make bold to change my subscription from J. C. to
the name the Lord has given to elect Gentiles, in the second
chapter of Hosea.&mdash;Wishing you a clean hand, a warm heart,
and a holy life,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">I remain, your&rsquo;s in him,<br />

<h2>LETTER II.</h2>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Achor&rsquo;s Vale</i>,
<i>April</i> 7, 1818.</p>
<p>Mrs. H&mdash;<span class="GutSmall">L</span>, Sen.</p>
<p><span class="GutSmall">MY DEAR FRIEND</span>,</p>
<p>I <span class="GutSmall">HAVE</span> been much grieved to hear
of your deep afflictions of body.&nbsp; I wish it lay in my power
to visit you, to read, pray, and converse with you.&nbsp; We have
spent some pleasant hours together in speaking of <i>him</i> who
loved us better than <i>he</i> loved himself; who did not grudge
to give <i>his</i> very life for us; and I really believe, if it
was needful, <i>he</i> would do it again, and not only so, but I
believe <i>he</i> would have done all <i>he</i> did, if it was
only for the salvation of one individual of <i>his</i>
people.&nbsp; Alas, my dear Mother; what do we know of <i>his</i>
love, the love of a God?&nbsp; <a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>All the knowledge the brightest saint
upon earth has of that subject is a mere nothing to the subject
itself.&nbsp; I want clearer apprehensions of it.&nbsp; I want to
feel its warming power.&nbsp; I want to see its divine
excellency.&nbsp; I want to rejoice in the God of love; he has
dealt well with me since I have been in this place.&nbsp; I trust
<i>he</i> has both pardoned and subdued <i>that</i> in me which
was contrary to <i>his</i> holy will.&nbsp; But I want this
blessing carried on in every hour&rsquo;s experience.&nbsp; May
the ever-blessed Spirit give us to believe in the love which God
has for us, and enable us to give credit to this most precious
truth for ourselves, &ldquo;I have blotted out as a thick cloud
thy sins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I really think we are often mistaken about our love to Christ;
for we fancy we have no spiritual affection for him, because we
are not in raptures of love with him; but let me remind you of
what the holy Apostle says of the matter.&nbsp; I have not time
or room in this short letter, to enlarge upon the subject, yet by
reading it yourself in the 13th of the 1st of <i>Cor.</i> it may
stir up your mind, and confirm you in the persuasion of
God&rsquo;s love to you: &ldquo;Charity thinketh no
evil.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Apostle does not say he, as a man,
thinketh no evil, but Charity, the love of God, the holy
principle in him thinketh no evil, of God or the doctrines of the
Gospel.&nbsp; It rejoiceth not in iniquity; then it is not a
principle of libertinism; but it rejoiceth in the truth, in
Christ, and in his word.&nbsp; It beareth all things God puts
upon it, although the old man rebels against the will of
God.&nbsp; It hopeth all things which God has promised.&nbsp; It
hateth iniquity.&nbsp; The carnal part in the regenerate, loves
sin, and seeks to be gratified, but this holy principle hates
it.&nbsp; It is <a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>kind, when the Saviour&rsquo;s sorrows are in
view.&nbsp; It suffereth long the unkindness of others, and
waiteth till God is pleased to deliver.&nbsp; It envieth no
man&rsquo;s gifts or goodness, but rests satisfied with God in
Christ.&nbsp; It is not puffed up, nor can it boast of what it
does, but it extols the Saviour; it delights in the Saviour; it
is willing to owe its all to the Saviour.&mdash;This is love, or
gospel Charity.&nbsp; This is that which is born of the Spirit,
which cannot sin.&nbsp; This is the seed of God, the new nature;
and these are the evidences of an interest in Christ, and you can
bless God at times, that you know these things by experience, in
some good degree.&nbsp; We have very sinful natures, but Christ
is our sanctification, in the holiness of his nature, before
God.&nbsp; We have broken the holy Law of God in thought, word,
and deed, but Jesus gave it all its vast demands, and perfectly
satisfied it.&nbsp; We have signed most awfully against a good
and gracious God, but Jesus has made an atonement for all
offences, and the Father has expressed his infinite pleasure in
the work of Christ, and he has promised to forgive and to forget
all our sins, by virtue of that one offering.&nbsp; May the
comfortable assurance of this sweet truth make us happy in life
and death.&nbsp; This will make our bed in our sickness, and
strengthen us on the bed of languishing, just as the ever-blessed
Spirit is pleased to open our minds, to receive it in the power,
sweetness, and glory of it.&nbsp; Several in your family I trust,
are effectually called by grace.&nbsp; What a mercy, that you
will soon meet them above&mdash;this is a pleasing thought to
depart with, and you have little else to do but to go home.</p>
<p>Do send me word how you all are in health; and <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>if you can
sit up to read, I will send you a precious little book,
&ldquo;Mr. Mason&rsquo;s thing needful,&rdquo; with those places
turned down that I have found precious to me.&mdash;May the Lord
shine upon you and in you,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">I remain, yours in him,<br />

<h2>LETTER III.</h2>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Achor&rsquo;s Vale</i>,
<i>June</i> 17, 1818.</p>
<p>Mr. &amp; Mrs. H&mdash;<span class="GutSmall">L</span>,
Jun.</p>
<p><span class="GutSmall">MY DEAR FRIENDS</span>,</p>
<p>Amidst the severest trials I am wading through this week, I
cannot forget you both.&nbsp; Surety you must be ready to exclaim
with pious David, &ldquo;Deep calleth into deep;&rdquo; and with
afflicted Job, &ldquo;Thou breakest me with breach upon
breach.&rdquo;&nbsp; Your afflictions are great indeed, I think
deeper than I could bear; the Lord has visited your house, but O!
what a sweet thought, it is a visit of <i>love</i>, of
<i>mercy</i> to you, but of <i>love</i> indeed, to the tender
babes.&nbsp; You will go to them through the same mercy and love,
but it would be neither love not mercy to let <i>them</i> return
to you.&nbsp; Dear, much esteemed Friends, I can feel for you, I
have been called to the same trouble, in part, nor shall I ever
fully forget what I then felt, when the soul of my dear daughter
took its flight, and when I laid her dust in the silent
receptacle for suffering mortality, but <i>it was well</i>; the
Lord demands, has demanded <i>his</i> own, <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>they were
<i>his</i> property, and <i>he</i> gave Mrs. Hill the honor to
bear them, with this charge, Take these children and nurse them
for <i>me</i>, <i>not</i> for sin, <i>nor</i> for the world,
<i>nor</i> for Satan, but for God&mdash;Selah.&nbsp; Nature no
doubt, most sensibly feels the stroke, but may the good hand of
God support you, and the full assurance of meeting them again,
bear up your sinking spirits like pillars of marble.&nbsp; I am
anxious to know how you are in mind and body, and assure you I
can weep with you, but I am fully persuaded you will see vast
wisdom in this stroke another day.&nbsp; Had you, Mrs. H. been
laid upon a sick and dying bed, while they were in helpless
infancy, it would have distressed your poor heart to leave them,
exposed to nobody knows <i>what</i> mother they might have.&nbsp;
A mother is every thing, this I can only know from observation,
but I observe among many unhappy persons I meet with in this
place, that they were either deprived of a tender mother, which
began their troubles, <i>or</i> that they had used a mother ill,
and God never prospered them after it.&nbsp; O my dear friends
the Lord has delivered you from many an heart-breaking sorrow,
and from much misery.&nbsp; Those dear creatures will afflict
you, they will trouble you <i>no</i> more for ever, either your
heart or your head.&nbsp; You are afflicted, the loss is great,
they were dear to your heart, but you are called to sacrifice
them, to restore them to their right owner; and while your
feelings struggle with God&rsquo;s will, methinks I hear the
Saviour say, &ldquo;Suffer them to come unto me, and forbid them
not, for of such is my kingdom composed.&rdquo;&nbsp; It has been
the opinion of some blessed men of God, that the majority of
saved persons in glory, are children.&nbsp; On <i>those</i> the
Lord has magnified the riches of <i>his</i> grace, and out of
their mouths God has ordained <i>his</i> own <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>glory, as
they must ascribe their salvation to free, unmerited mercy
alone.&nbsp; Dear babes, what must have been their surprize, when
they started from the body and arrived in glory; when their
little powers were expanded and their minds filled with the joys
of Jesus.&nbsp; Think often of their joyful arrival, and if they
could see you shed a tear about them, it would almost induce them
to appear to you, saying, If you loved us you would rejoice,
because we are gone to our Father, and the world seeth us no
more; we are entered into peace, we have done for ever with
<i>sin</i>, in which we were born, and with <i>sorrow</i> as the
consequence, and shall be now for ever with the Lord.&nbsp; Happy
voyagers, no sooner set sail than they are arrived at their
desired haven; hasty <i>sojourners</i>, they found nothing here
worth their stay; they were afflicted, and like <i>their</i> dear
Lord, only tasted the vinegar and the gall.&nbsp; But they have
left their parents to drink deep of the cup of sorrow, they have
turned their heads away and refused the draught; they opened
their eyes, saw the light, and after a little, they withdrew into
the regions of eternal day&mdash;your lilies are cropt, and will
flourish in the garden of eternal bliss for ever.&nbsp; Those
tender plants, those lovely flowers are removed into a shelter,
before the thunders roar, the lightnings fly, and the tempest
pours its rage.&nbsp; They were sinners, or else they could
neither have suffered or died; but loved, redeemed, and secretly
sanctified by the indwelling of the holy Spirit, they winged
their way to God.&nbsp; How joyful their meeting, see them clasp
each other, see <i>them smile</i> and <i>triumph</i>, and
<i>join</i> the chorus of the skies.</p>
<blockquote><p>Our dear, our mourning parents both farewell,<br
/>
We go from you, with Christ in heaven to dwell,<br />
<a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>We go to
see our heavenly Father&rsquo;s face,<br />
We go to sing redeeming love and grace.<br />
We go to learn the sciences divine,<br />
We go in glory&rsquo;s bright array to shine,<br />
We go to joys, which cannot be exprest,<br />
We go to God, to be for ever blest:<br />
And can you wish us back to earth again,<br />
To be afflicted there with toil and pain,<br />
To be with dire convulsions rack&rsquo;d and tore,<br />
The tortur&rsquo;d little babes we were before.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>May you, my dear friends be prepared to meet them, by an
experimental acquaintance with the blood and righteousness of
Christ; let this your prayer, day and night.&mdash;Christian love
to all your dear family,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Your sympathizing Friend,<br />

<h2>LETTER IV.</h2>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Valley of Achor</i>.</p>
<p>Mr. T. Hill, Jun.</p>
<p><span class="GutSmall">MY DEAR FRIEND TITUS</span>,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> would be very ungrateful in me
to forget you, or to neglect writing to you among the many
friends who have kindly visited me in my affliction, and have not
been ashamed of Christ, nor of me his unworthy servant.&nbsp;
That gracious God, who has the hearts of men in his hands, has
kept you in the truth, though you have been opposed, and
altho&rsquo; <a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>you could not do that for me you could have wished, but
you have often wisely cautioned me against that freedom of spirit
which has often occasioned fools to insult my feelings, and to
triumph in my supposed weakness.&nbsp; It was not without reason
the Saviour, as man, did not commit himself to man, for it is
said, &ldquo;He knew what was in man, and he needed none to
testify of that to him.&rdquo;&nbsp; And now, my dear friend,
permit me to remark, that some have gone with God&rsquo;s people
till they get into the slough, and there they have left them and
religion together; but although trouble has turned some back, and
has slain its thousands, yet prosperity and carnal ease has slain
its <i>ten</i> thousands&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>For more the treach&rsquo;rous calm I dread,<br />
Than tempests bursting o&rsquo;er my head.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we belong to the family of God, we shall never be long
without a cross, in some way or other; but if we do not belong to
God Satan will let us alone&mdash;it is his work to disturb and
distress the former, and to render his life unhappy; and it his
work also, to lull asleep those who are his own
children&mdash;better therefore be under the chastening hand of
God all our days than be fast asleep in the arms of sin and
Satan.&nbsp; The whole world is divided into two classes only,
the seed of the Serpent, and the seed of the Woman, and this we
feel within.&nbsp; I beg my dear friend will not think it strange
when God gives him to feel his own native sinfulness, when he
feels all that deadness and carnality that is inherent in his
nature; this, when properly felt and seen, will trouble him at
all times, but I hope when this is the case, that he will not
fall into <a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>that snare of the devil&rsquo;s which I have known some
young persons to be trapped with, when Satan suggests, O you are
nothing but an hypocrite&mdash;your conduct and inbred sins prove
it.&nbsp; You had better give up religion, or else it will make
worse for you in hell.&nbsp; Listen not to this a moment, but fly
to the Saviour&mdash;be honest; tell <i>him</i> all that you feel
and are ensnared with.&nbsp; Plead <i>his</i> sufferings,
obedience, death, and intercession.&nbsp; Beg the holy Spirit to
shew you these things in such a powerful way as shall subdue sin,
<i>not root it out</i>, as certain preachers say&mdash;no, the
Canaanite will be in the land as long as you live, else where
would be the warfare?&nbsp; How could we live by faith on the
work of Jesus? and where would be the use of the greatest part of
his promises, and the account of the experiences of the tried
saints?&nbsp; You have <i>three</i> combined enemies, the World,
the Flesh, and the Devil; but you have <i>three</i> glorious
friends, the adorable <i>Father</i>, <i>Son</i>, and
<i>Spirit</i>.&nbsp; You have <i>three</i> besetments,
<i>Passion</i>, <i>Lust</i>, and <i>Pride</i>; but you have
<i>three</i> remedies, Christ&rsquo;s <i>Obedience</i>,
<i>Blood</i>, and <i>Love</i>.&nbsp; These when seen, known,
felt, and enjoyed, produce <i>three</i> most blessed effects,
<i>Abasement</i>, <i>Humility</i>, <i>and Self-Denial</i>; and
this will lead to the practice of <i>three</i> duties,
<i>Prayer</i>, <i>Hearing</i>, and <i>Obedience</i>; and these
will be a means of the gracious visits of <i>three</i> gracious,
kind, and condescending persons.&nbsp; If any man love me, my
Father will love <i>him</i>, and <i>we</i> will come to
<i>him</i>, and make <i>our</i> abode with <i>him</i>; when
<i>he</i>, the Spirit, shall come, <i>he</i> shall abide with you
for ever.&nbsp; Thus you see the connexion of great things in
experience, to lead us to glory, where we shall be filled with
<i>three</i> more.&nbsp; The Lamb in the midst of the throne,
shall lead them to fountain of living waters&mdash;<i>Father</i>,
<i>Son</i>, and <i>Spirit</i>&mdash;then with <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>unspeakable
joy shall we draw waters of everlasting delight from seeing,
knowing, and being with God.&mdash;Blessed are the pure in heart,
for they shall see God.&nbsp; The heart means the whole man, body
and soul, purged from sin, unpardoned by the death of
Jesus&mdash;the faculties that are under the influence of divine
favor; the conscience, that feels guilt when sin is felt, and
peace when faith is able to receive the atonement.&mdash;The
mind, will, and affections, which are open to receive Christ as
he is set forth in the Gospel.&nbsp; The truth being received
gives Christ an actual existence in the mind, so that he dwells
there, and let what will happen to us Christ is uppermost.&nbsp;
When Satan, sin, error, trouble, the deepest affliction, or the
thoughts of death, judgment, and eternity impress the mind, do
observe this, Christ is still uppermost; the mind bends that way
as naturally, in this sense, as a child runs home, and clings to
its parent in time of trouble or danger.&nbsp; I have had a long
experience of these truths, and only regret that I have had so
little time to reflect deeper on them.&nbsp; I see the wisdom of
God in the present trial which has befallen me&mdash;the Lord has
done what he devised; I am the gainer, my dear friends the
loosers, but they will gain in the end; the Lord has chastened
and humbled me, and has accepted my broken spirit and contrite
heart.&nbsp; He has shewed me my faults in many things I never
saw before, and others I had forgot, and has led me to see he has
pardoned them, and I trust subdued what is contrary to
himself.&nbsp; What the Lord is about to do with me I know not, I
leave it with him&mdash;I only want this pruning to bring forth
more fruit, that I may glorify Christ and prove that I am a
disciple indeed.</p>
<p><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>The
eternal God be your guide, father and friend.&nbsp; Do pray much,
read much, think much, and obey much.&nbsp; Still cry out, God be

<p><span class="GutSmall">MY DEAR FRIEND</span>,</p>
<p>I have many friends of your name, and thousands know I have
also many enemies of the same name, though they never saw me;
there are little hills of Zion, loved of the Lord, and hilly
difficulties to encounter.&nbsp; I am sure you will smile, when I
observe I have often noticed, that if God raises me up a friend,
the Devil often raises me up an enemy of the same name; but this
is the experience I have long had, of <i>mercies</i> and
<i>miseries</i>, dark <i>nights</i> and cheerful <i>days</i>, <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>heavy
<i>losses</i> and great spiritual <i>gains</i>, sore
<i>temptations</i> and seasonable <i>helps</i>; <i>tears</i> and
<i>smiles</i>, castings <i>down</i> and liftings <i>up</i>, fits
of <i>despair</i> and lively <i>hopes</i>, the powers of
<i>unbelief</i> and the triumphs of <i>faith</i>, the heart at
times <i>fretting</i> against the Lord, then all at once sweet
<i>submission</i> to his will; a glorious <i>time</i> in the
pulpit, and the very next <i>time</i>, shut up, barren and dead:
a sweet testimony from some poor soul of the Lord&rsquo;s giving
efficacy to the word of his grace, by my message, <i>another</i>
comes in directly after, to tell me some <i>one</i> has turned an
enemy.&nbsp; <i>Hearing</i> the Lord has blessed some of my poor
writings, and <i>presently</i> the Devil has sent the baser sort
to blow their horns about the streets, proclaiming my supposed
infamy.&nbsp; Perhaps a precious soul-animating <i>letter</i> is
sent me, and while reading it, the post-man brings another,
filled with the most abominable obscenity, written, no doubt, by
an hypocritical professor&mdash;one part of the day enjoying the
very life and <i>power</i> of religion, the other part
<i>lean</i>, <i>barren</i>, and <i>trifling</i>.&nbsp; I could
enlarge on this, and fill a volume, but I must inform you I am
reading the Pilgrims Progress, and find it very blessed; it is a
glass, wherein I see much of the face of my own experience; I
intend in many future letters to my friends, to quote and explain
a part of it, especially those parts which are the most
intricate, and perhaps the least noticed.&nbsp; It is an
invaluable book; others have attempted to write similar books,
but they are all very inferior to the Tinker&rsquo;s Master-piece
of Piety and Genius.&nbsp; Here I see the chequered scene the
Lord generally leads <i>his</i> people through, from conversion
to glorification.&nbsp; Here we see the christian <i>burdened</i>
and <i>delivered</i>, <i>sighing</i> and <i>singing</i>, on the
<i>mount</i> of communion and in the <i>shadow</i> of death,
loaded with <i>corruption</i> <a name="page22"></a><span

<i>condemned</i> and <i>justified</i>, <i>happy</i> and
<i>miserable</i>, meeting a few real <i>pilgrims</i> and plenty
of <i>hypocrites</i>, <i>fighting</i> and<i> fainting</i>,
<i>rising</i> and <i>falling</i>, yet <i>kept</i>,
<i>sanctified</i>, and <i>assured</i> of glory.&nbsp; Sometimes
<i>groaning</i> under a body of death, then <i>soaring</i> with
the wings of a dove; brought out of <i>self</i> and <i>living</i>
by faith, on the <i>person</i> and <i>love</i>, the <i>work</i>
and <i>grace</i> of Christ.&nbsp; I trust you will be led to seek
Jesus the Pearl of great Price&mdash;never rest till you have
found <i>him</i>, for it is life eternal to be favored with an
experimental knowledge of <i>him</i>.&nbsp; May your heart be led
from every thing else, and fixed <i>there</i> alone; that you may
know and enjoy all that is implied in this greatest of texts,
&ldquo;For thy Maker is thy husband, the Lord of Hosts is

<h2>LETTER VII.</h2>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Valley of Achor</i>, <i>Sept.</i>
1, 1818.</p>
<p>Mr. H. H&mdash;<span class="GutSmall">L</span>,</p>
<p><span class="GutSmall">MY DEAR YOUNG FRIEND</span>,</p>
<p>I beg you will have the goodness to send me the truly
excellent Dr. Hawker&rsquo;s Concordance, I think it would be a
great treat to me just now.&nbsp; I am astonished when I read any
of that blessed man&rsquo;s late <a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>Writings, to see how he has grown up
in the gracious knowledge of Christ.&nbsp; I must for ever admire
that divine hand which has planted, watered, pruned, and reared
up such a tree of righteousness.&nbsp; But does it not hurt your
feelings to see the awful opposition made against him for the
truth&rsquo;s sake, even in this Christ-despising day.&nbsp; I
own it often distresses me, and indeed, such have been the
lessons I have learned since I last saw you, that I am lost in
wonder that God does not damn every creature, let the curtain of
time drop, and burn the world to ashes!</p>
<p>Since I have been here I have seen so much of the evil of sin
in myself, in God&rsquo;s people, in ministers, in professors, in
pharisees, in erroneous characters, and in the profane world,
that I have been overcome with the sight.&nbsp; Above all I am
most affected with the sight of sin in the sorrows of
Jesus.&nbsp; Here, O here may we ever be divinely and suitably
affected.&nbsp; Here alone we see it in its most hideous
forms.&nbsp; The Lord help us to hate it, and flee from it as
from the face of a Serpent.</p>
<p>I trust you are going on in the divine life, and that you
still find the ministry of good Mr. Wilkinson, who is one of the
greatest ornaments in the Church of England, very profitable to
your soul&mdash;the Lord help you to go on till you finish your
course with joy.&mdash;With respect to myself, I believe I am now
very blessedly, though <i>painfully</i>, experiencing the
fulfilment of that precious promise, in Ezekiel xxxvith, From all
your filthiness and from all your idols will I cleanse you.&nbsp;
This is done by the manifestation of the atonement, the
application of truth, and the power of the <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>Gospel, by
the sacred indwelling and the powerful operations of the
ever-blessed Spirit.&nbsp; But the furnace of affliction
generally attends this work&mdash;many long to see me out of it;
and my nature often rebels against it, but faith knows, it is
good to be here.&nbsp; The filthiness from which we must be
cleansed is all the uncleanness; pollution, and impurity of our
defiled nature, in their guilt, love, power, and
practice&mdash;from <i>these</i> will I cleanse them.&nbsp; The
idols or idolatry are things loved, adored, and enshrined in our
affections as rivals to God; these must come down, that Christ
may be all in all; and so must all our natural religion if ever
we get sweetly established in the truth.&nbsp; I am well
satisfied with the Lord&rsquo;s dealings with me, and at times I
can submit to this chastisement, just as the Pilgrims did.&nbsp;
So Bunyan says, &ldquo;Then I saw in my dream that the Shining
One told them to lie down, which they did, and he chastised them
sore; and as he chastised them with the whip of small cords, he
said, As many as I love I rebuke and chasten; be zealous
therefore, and repent.&nbsp; This done, he bid them go on their
way, and follow the advice of the Shepherds, looking unto
Jesus.&rdquo;&nbsp; Why were they thus scourged? they had got
vain confident, thought highly of themselves, their gifts,
attainments, experience, manifestations, graces, works,
sincerity, sufferings, and services.&nbsp; These look well
without, but it is only a black monster in a white robe&mdash;the
devil spreading a net for their feet to turn them into
self-admiration, from Christ.&nbsp; This is one of the paths of
the destroyer&mdash;here I have often been, to my shame I speak
it, nor can I escape the cross for it; but this text cheers me,
As many as I love&mdash;not as many as I hate, but <i>love</i>, I
rebuke and chasten.&nbsp; The gardener takes but little <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>notice of
that tree he intends to cut down.&nbsp; He never manures, primes,
waters, or defends it; but he does all these things to his own
plantation&mdash;you know how to apply it.&mdash;Grace be with
you.&mdash;Kind respects to your better half, and my old kind

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Lawson</span>,</p>
<p><span class="GutSmall">MY DEAR AFFLICTED FRIEND</span>,</p>
<p>Are you still in the furnace of affliction?&nbsp; I am
astonished when I behold what heavy pressures, deep heart-felt
sorrows, and mighty loads of accumulated grief, some of
God&rsquo;s children are called to bear, and that for years
together; but what can we not endure, through all-sufficient
grace?&nbsp; I hope you find this grace supporting you, and at
all times giving you kind assurances of glory.&nbsp; That you can
say, with the same confidence as the Apostle, and all established
believers, &ldquo;We know, that if this earthly house of our
tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building, a house not made
with hands, eternal in the heavens.&rdquo;&nbsp; Where those
heavens are it is of very little importance for you and me to
know; our main concern is with the house there, called by our
dear Lord, Many mansions.&nbsp; Our dwelling house, mansions, and
joy, <a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>will
not consist in merely being in a place called heaven, but it will
lay in the full enjoyment of the love, favor, approbation, and
sight of God in Christ; this was Job&rsquo;s hope and
expectation, &ldquo;In my flesh I shall see God:&rdquo;&mdash;and
this is the promise to the Church, &ldquo;They shall see his
face.&rdquo;&nbsp; David was so transported with this, that he
exclaimed, in the sweetest confidence, &ldquo;As for me, I will
behold thy face in righteousness.&nbsp; I shall be satisfied when
I awake in thy likeness.&rdquo;&nbsp; There will be no beholding
the face of the dear Immanuel but in his righteousness.&nbsp;
This glorious robe is imputed by God the Father, to poor
sinners.&nbsp; We are taught out of his Law our need of this
Surety&rsquo;s righteousness; we are clothed with it, and brought
by the Father in it to his dear Son, who graciously accepts us in
it, owns us as his own, and gives us the Spirit of Adoption, to
say, &ldquo;My Father.&rdquo;&mdash;The blessed Spirit carries on
this work, by enlarging the heart, expanding the mind, and
extending our views in the knowledge of Christ; and the longer we
live the more we learn the real value of Christ&mdash;his goings
forth in eternity, in a way of love to us&mdash;his mysterious
incarnation&mdash;his surprising condescension&mdash;his holy
life of obedience, and his great act of putting sin away, by the
sacrifice of himself.&nbsp; These become precious to our souls as
we grow in knowledge; nor do we stop here: the glorious victories
he has obtained, the value of his work, and the acceptableness of
it to God; the life of Mediation he is living for us in heaven,
and the prevalency of his intercession; these are our food, our
feast of fat things.&mdash;But the ever blessed Spirit carries on
his work, till he has given us most exalted views of his Person,
as one in the divine essence; as the Son of God, <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>in away not
known to angels or men; as God-Man Mediator; as the glorious head
of the Church, and the Saviour of the body, and as our all in
all.&nbsp; This is knowing Christ, and wherever the Lord has
bestowed this favour on the soul, whatever trials, temptations,
or griefs, may beset or befal them, such shall hold on their way,
and wax stronger and stronger&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Tho&rsquo; thousand snares beset his feet,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Not one shall hold him fast;<br />
Whatever dangers he may meet,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He shall get safe at last.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Lord refresh your soul with these blessed things, that you
may say with your afflicted brother, &ldquo;This is my comfort in
my affliction, thy word hath quickened me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Permit me
to remind you, that God doth not willingly afflict, nor grieve
us; there is a cause.&nbsp; We are sinners, and God will make us
know it.&nbsp; God chastens us for our profit, that we may be
partakers of his holiness.&nbsp; Every rod was eternally
appointed for us; we shall have all that is allotted to
us&mdash;men and devils can add no more to them; for if God
appoints their number ten we never shall have eleven.</p>
<p>I dare say you are anxious at times to know how I am, and how
I go on.&nbsp; Look into your own experience, and you will know
that, for as in water face answereth to face, so doth the heart
of one child of God to another.&nbsp; Remember, he hath, he doth,
he will deliver you.&nbsp; Wishing you the smiles of him, who is
the health of your countenance, and your delivering God, I

<p>Mr. &amp; Mrs. F.</p>
<p><span class="GutSmall">MY DEAR FRIENDS</span>,</p>
<p>I need not apologize, I hope, for troubling you with a few
lines, as I trust you are born of God, and <i>love God as he is
in Jesus</i>, though perhaps you feel at times much grief of
heart, that you enjoy so little of the sweetness of believing in
Christ.&nbsp; What a mercy God makes us manifest to each others
hearts, that we belong to his family; but the witness of God is
greater, this is infinitely preferable to any human testimony,
however clear and pleasing it may be to us, in point of brotherly
love, and we which believe, have the witness in ourselves, we can
prove that God has done something for us; though this work may be
under a cloud for a time, yet the Lord the Spirit renews it,
clears it up, makes it plain, and encourages us to hope in
himself till faith is lost in sight, and hope in full
enjoyment.&nbsp; Blessed be God we are getting nearer home, and
though we seem to lag and hang back, yet God declares he will
save her that halteth, and her that he has afflicted, therefore,
on his divine faithfulness let us hope for what he has promised
to us, and our expectation shall not be cut off.&nbsp; This is a
sweet encouragement to my soul, in my painful pilgrimage, but
when I look to the promises, to Christ in the promises, and to
his fidelity, I thank God and take courage.&nbsp; The Lord deals
well with me in the land of my captivity, and I <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>only want
more faith to trust in him, greater submission to his will, a
living upon him as he is set forth, a leaving all with him, to
manage for me, and to favor me with the presence of the holy
spirit, in his saving offices; as a spirit of revelation in my
understanding, as a spirit of power on my will, as a spirit of
faith in my heart, as a spirit of love in my affections, as a
spirit of light in my judgment, and as a spirit of peace in my
conscience; with his constant operations as a spirit of
supplication, enabling me at all times to draw near unto
God&mdash;this is that seven-fold operation of the divine spirit
which we daily need.&nbsp; You have your trials as well as I
have, and it is of very little consequence where we have them,
whether in my state or in yours, none of the children of God are
exempt from the blessed peace Christ has made, and of course they
are not exempt from the tribulation he has promised&mdash;they
both go together, and perhaps my present place, was the spot
appointed from all eternity, where I was to enjoy the solid peace
of the gospel; and this I trust I shall be much favored with
before I return; it is in this pleasing hope I live, I have much
to oppose and much to encourage that hope, our path-way dear
brother is through fire and water, and our way to glory is up
hill.&nbsp; Our spirits tire, flag, weary, get heavy and faint,
but we go on from strength to strength, till we get home.</p>

<p style="text-align: right"><i>Valley of Achor</i>,
<i>January</i> 1, 1818.</p>
<p>Mr. &amp; Mrs. W. R&mdash;<span class="GutSmall">T</span>.</p>
<p>Grace be onto you and peace.&nbsp; I have often admired the
grace of our Lord Jesus in its freedom, in its sovereignty, and
in its power, in our complete and eternal salvation&mdash;this
you and I shall have to bless God for, to all eternity; and if
you was snatched away by death this moment, you would be ready to
praise and adore God for it&mdash;and surely our fitness for a
better world is to be enabled upon earth to give the glory due to
his name.&nbsp; No doubt you will most readily unite with me in
this particular, that it requires great grace to support and
uphold a man in great difficulties, but while the left hand of
God is laid upon him, does not the right hand of grace support,
and at times console and cheer his heart.&nbsp; Perhaps this is
the meaning of that important text, &ldquo;His left hand is under
my head, and his right hand doth embrace me.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is
the grace I now need.&nbsp; I will not trouble you with a list of
my sorrows, but can assure you they are greater than I ever did,
or ever can tell any one in the world.&nbsp; Satan is busy in
raking up all my faults, from childhood.&nbsp; Carnal reason
thinks God deals very hard with me.&nbsp; Sense can see no
further than to-day, and suggests I shall die beneath my
load.&nbsp; Fancy paints out a thousand troubles I may never see;
while unbelief is ready to give the lie to every promise in the
Bible, and wants to persuade me to give up praying, and <a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>abandon
myself to despair.&nbsp; Thus I am tried every day, and much
deeper now than when I first entered this Valley.&nbsp; But,
hark! the voice of love and mercy sounds from the covenant of
grace, &ldquo;For a small moment have I forsaken thee, but with
great mercies I will gather thee.&nbsp; I will correct thee in
measure, but thou shalt never be forgotten of me.&nbsp; I will
deliver thee, but the times and seasons the Father hath put in
his own power.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then another voice sounds from
Calvary, &ldquo;I have blotted out, as a cloud, thy
sins&mdash;return unto me, for I have redeemed thee.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Here faith listens, and asks, What <i>me</i> Lord?&nbsp; Yes,
you, by name.&nbsp; Then I reply, Lord there may be others of my
name.&nbsp; True; but the Persons for whom I entered into
covenant, for whom I became incarnate, for whom I obeyed the Law,
for whom I suffered, and for whom the rich blessings of the
Gospel is provided, are <i>sinners</i>&mdash;this is your nature,
your action, and your name, and I have denominated you by the
very names you have given yourself, from your own convictions and
feelings.&nbsp; Bring in hither the poor, the halt, the blind,
the lame, and the needy.&nbsp; Surely I must come under some of
these; and according to different states so we are named.</p>
<p>Here I beg my dear sister R&rsquo;s most particular
attention.&nbsp; I know she is a patient in Free-grace Hospital,
and I want her assured that her case is not forgotten by the most
blessed Physician of Souls, who has said, &ldquo;I am the Lord
that healeth thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; Convinced of our state as
sinners, we feel poor indeed&mdash;without spiritual money, or
cloaths, or home, or friends!&mdash;this is real
poverty&mdash;the charge brought against the Church at Laodicea,
&ldquo;Thou knowest not that thou <a name="page32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>art poor, and miserable, and blind,
and naked.&rdquo;&nbsp; This charge belongs to hypocrites, and
not to a poor sinner, whose emptiness is daily felt, and perhaps
faith is too weak to draw much comfort from the
Promises&mdash;and God the Spirit has shewn you the darkness of
nature.&nbsp; Now God does not say you are blind, but he calls us
by the name we give ourselves.&nbsp; Hence, God says, &ldquo;Hear
ye deaf, and look ye blind, that ye may see.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
because every little makes us start, or keeps us back from
praying, hoping, and believing, we are called the halt, and the
lame; and as our sins too often rise and gain the ascendancy over
us, that we cannot exercise strong confidence in Jesus, and his
work, so we are called the maimed.&nbsp; Sin and Satan has maimed
us, and wicked fellows have thrown stones at us, as
Christ&rsquo;s sheep, and maimed us: and I can assure you there
is not any thing that Jesus has said or done, but it is the
blessed office of the Holy Ghost to shew us our need of it; and
if he sets us longing for it, travailing in soul, agonizing in
spirit, and most sincerely desirous of the blessing, he will
communicate it, for he has said, &ldquo;Shall I cause to travail,
and not bring forth?&nbsp; Shall I bring to the birth, and shut
the womb?&rdquo;&nbsp; You are longing to bring forth the
exercise of precious faith, lively hope, cheerful confidence; and
you are at times longing for the salvation of God, and you will
not be disappointed.&nbsp; But do not be alarmed&mdash;even these
longing desires may be in a great measure suspended&mdash;this
has often alarmed me, till some Promise or a sweet Sermon, or a
precious Hymn, have set me longing again; or else some new and
heavy cross has come on.&nbsp; This sets me to confessing, to
searching, to reading to humility, to waiting, and standing on my
watch tower, to hear what God the Lord will <a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>say.&nbsp; I
hear what Satan, the world, and mistaken possessors say, not what
carnal reason, unbelief, and sense has to say&mdash;these all
want to swear away my eternal life; they are not the judges of
the court; they dont understand the nature of the case; and it is
a man&rsquo;s privilege to appeal from a low to a higher court;
thus did Paul and lost his head, thus did I and lost my
liberty.&nbsp; But though this may be the case in temporals, yet
it is not so in spirituals; all judgment is committed to Christ,
because he is the Son of Man; he is the judge in the court of
mercy, and I will hear what the Lord will say.&nbsp; Moses has
condemned me, conscience has said Amen to the sentence, justice
demands satisfaction, the law is broken, guilt is great, Satan is
busy, hell appears open, heaven shut, and the soul trembles, and
with all the heart exclaims, God be merciful to me, to me a
sinner!&nbsp; And amidst all, will you believe it, faith is
waiting for the sentence from the judge; and when it is cut him
down, O justice&mdash;take him, O Satan&mdash;close upon him, O
hell.&nbsp; No, not so, but, poor sinner look up, be of good
cheer, thy sins are forgiven thee&mdash;but how, Lord? and he
shewed him his hands and his side.&nbsp; I trust my dear Brother
has had many such views, not only when liberty first came, but
many times after, when the whole work has been as it were dead,
and lost; yet there has been many revivals again, and no doubt
will, till death.&nbsp; I hope you are both well.&nbsp; I only
want another piece of a broiled fish, and of a honey-comb, (John,
21) both are gifts.&nbsp; A common blessing in a kind providence,
is a fish, and grace to enjoy it, is an honey-comb.&nbsp; Though
to poor ministers, a soul is compared to a fish, and if they are
led to ask for the salvation of a soul, or for success in their
ministry when they go a fishing&mdash;surely <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>the Lord will
not give them a Scorpion, that is, a reprobate.&nbsp; The Lord
grant we may be found among the good fish at the end of the
world, when the gospel net will be full, and the grand separation
take place.&nbsp; Till then may we swim in the ocean of mercy,
with the fins of faith and love.&nbsp; The Lord bless thee with
every needful grace.</p>

<p style="text-align: right"><i>Valley of Achor</i>,
<i>December</i> 17<i>th</i>, 1817.</p>
<p>Mr. &amp; Mrs. F.</p>
<p><span class="GutSmall">BELOVED OF THE LORD</span>,</p>
<p>I trust you are growing into an increasing acquaintance with
the Lord Jesus, and the work of his Spirit on the heart.&nbsp; I
have often admired that grand promise in the book of Job,
&ldquo;Thine age shall be clear as the noon day.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
is very blessed to look back on the way the Lord has led us, and
the work he has wrought in us&mdash;may he give you special light
to see it.&nbsp; The Queen of Sheba admired many things about
Solomon&rsquo;s buildings, and the Holy Ghost has thought fit to
record this one among the rest&mdash;the ascent to the house of
the Lord.&nbsp; Blessed be God you have got up some of those
steps; and though you may be sensible of many a stumble, and many
a fall by the way, yet you have not fell from God, nor out of the
way, and as sure as your hope, faith, and mind is supremely
placed on him, you will gradually ascend that road, which <a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>you will find
lead you to glory at last.&nbsp; Perhaps you have ascended seven
of those steps: first, God has shewed you in some measure, and at
times very deeply, that you have no good in yourself.&nbsp;
Second, he has been pleased to let in a ray of light into the
mind, by which you have seen something so precious in Christ,
that you could truly say, you would willingly part with all for
him.&nbsp; Third, the blessed Spirit has bowed your will, or
rather given you another will, a new will, by which, you have
made a most blessed choice of the Lord Jesus, who is the object
of the Father&rsquo;s delight, so that you could see your will
and the will of God, perfectly correspond.&nbsp; Fourth, the Lord
has given you to believe in Jesus, to present salvation: your
heart has most divinely rested upon his finished work, and you
have found it very safe.&nbsp; Fifth, you have enjoyed the
privileges of the children, in fellowship with those who love
God, at his table, in his house, and in his word.&nbsp; Sixth,
the habitual sanctification of the mind, in various actings;
sometimes of faith, hope, love, humility, patience, and
self-denial.&nbsp; Seventh, a resting satisfied with Christ, as
all in all; anxious for more knowledge of him, that you may feel
your confidence in him grow&mdash;that you may be more than ever
devoted to his glory.&nbsp; Thus you can say, to the honor of the
blessed Spirit, that he has led you up some of those steps of
experimental knowledge&mdash;and let me assure you, from the most
undoubted authority, that as many as are led by the Spirit of
God, they are the sons of God.&nbsp; I feel great pleasure in
writing this short note&mdash;blessed be God nothing alters the
religion of the heart, only it must be tried, something will
surely try it; all the spoils that were taken from the enemy
among the Israelites, was to go through fire, or <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>through
water, and as we are the spoils Christ has taken from the enemy,
so we must go through the water of common trials, and the fire of
uncommon afflictions&mdash;but hark! how graciously he
speaks,</p>
<blockquote><p>For I will be with thee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy troubles to bless,<br />
And sanctify to thee<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy greatest distress.</p>

<h2>LETTER XII.</h2>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Valley of Achor</i>, <i>Oct.</i>
20, 1818.</p>
<p>Mrs. E&mdash;<span class="GutSmall">R</span>.</p>
<p><span class="GutSmall">MY DEAR FRIEND</span>,</p>
<p>Agreeable to my promise, I will attempt an answer to your
anxious letter, although I feel great reluctance in so doing,
knowing well, that not he which commendeth himself should be
approved, but him whom the Lord commendeth.&nbsp; It is the mercy
of all God&rsquo;s children, that they stand approved in Christ,
and as an evidence of it, they, through the teaching of the holy
Spirit, approve of Christ, and all in Christ.&nbsp; Our work, as
fellow Christians, should consist daily in commending Christ, and
recommending him to each other&mdash;this ought to be our
constant employment and delight, especially ministers of the
gospel, in their public exercises; but alas, we live in a day in
which I am sorry to say, the man, who can best commend himself,
set up his own experience, and dwell much upon the marvellous, is
the man who is the most acceptable.&nbsp; <a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>This is an
awful proof of the degenerate state of the church, yet I do
consider it as my duty, to vindicate myself and friends, from
that censure which we do not merit, and which is most unjustly
heaped upon us.&nbsp; In doing this in my address to you, I aim
merely to correct some mistakes under which you lay, and feel
much bondage as the consequence.&nbsp; In doing this, I could
certainly fill a volume, but I shall only <i>assure you in a few
words</i>, <i>what</i> <span class="GutSmall">IS</span>, <i>and
what is</i> <span class="GutSmall">NOT</span> <i>the
case</i>.</p>
<p>First: You have beep informed that I am happy.&nbsp; In reply
to this I beg to observe, I cannot be very comfortable, when I
reflect that the precious cause of Christ, probably, has received
a wound through my carelessness&mdash;and <i>if</i> any part of
my conduct has given occasion for the enemies of Christ to
blaspheme, or to increase their hatred to the Gospel; this is an
heart-breaking circumstance to me.&mdash;Secondly: To be deprived
of the blessed ordinances which I once so richly enjoyed, is a
source of much sorrow&mdash;never did I know their value as I now
do; nor can I wonder at David, when in exile exclaiming,
&ldquo;My flesh and heart crieth out for the courts of my
God.&rdquo;&mdash;Third: The afflictions of the Church since the
commencement of my troubles, in September, 1816, must deeply
affect me.&nbsp; Its loss of that poor, feeble ministry of
unworthy me.&nbsp; Its divisions, and the many apparent attempts
to deprive them even of the place to meet in; with the scoffs,
jeers, and contempt of the proud they have to bear.&nbsp; Believe
me I am grieved for the afflictions of Joseph, for surely no
vessel in a storm has been much worse torn to pieces than our
poor Church, which I have long named the &ldquo;Packet
Distress.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another <a name="page38"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>part of her affliction has been from
the lies of certain Ministers, who have attempted to build their
Churches with what materials they could collect from us, to keep
up the fire amongst us, and increase our afflictions&mdash;they
are perpetually running about, to degrade both myself and
people.&nbsp; I could mention their names, if it were prudent,
but they are well known.&nbsp; The main point they aim at, is to
hurt me in the estimation of <i>the few godly characters we have
left</i>, and <i>this</i> is their common cant&mdash;&ldquo;No
doubt Mr. C. is certainly a fallen character, but even
<i>that</i> we might pardon, did we but see him sorry for it; but
instead of that, he is as cheerful, light, and trifling as
ever.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is always expressed with much seeming
pity, sorrow, and concern, but could you see the heart of
hypocrisy lurking at the bottom, and the infernal design of such
initiations, you would despise such persons, who are described in
the Bible as hawking pedlars&mdash;&ldquo;Thou shalt not go up
and down as a tale bearer among my people.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such are
like sharks, following a sick ship.&mdash;And now comes another
daring, cruel, and unjust charge: &ldquo;O, Mr. C. I hear, is
supported in his situation by just such fellows as
himself.&rdquo;&nbsp; But my dear friend, the persons who support
me, and my dear children, are chiefly a few pious women, of good
character, and who are well known in the Church: and as to bad
characters, men or women, whom I know to be such, I am determined
at all times to deal faithfully with, and then they will soon
leave me.&nbsp; Another charge you hear of is &ldquo;That there
are many bad people in the congregation, and who attend the
sacrament now.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is another falsehood, for the
deacons will not allow any person of bad conduct to communicate
with the church at the Lord&rsquo;s supper; and if you know any
<a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>that do,
in that church, you are highly culpable if you do not inform the
deacons of it&mdash;&ldquo;Thou shalt not suffer sin upon thy
neighbour.&rdquo;&nbsp; Many persons, both public and private
characters, have used the tongue to degrade both myself and the
people who worshipped with me, but who would find enough to do,
to look at home; while they can find out one fault, which they
suppose I possess, their neighbours, perhaps, can find out an
hundred of theirs.</p>
<p>It is truly laughable to see the toil, trouble, and expence
that many have been at to circulate my supposed infamy, that
would not take that trouble, either to save their own souls from
hell, or relieve an afflicted person; yet such make a profession
of religion, and assign the same hypocritical reason for their
opposition to me, which the heathens did of old for their
oppression of the Israelites, (Jeremiah l. ver. 7.)&nbsp; All
that found them have devoured them, and their adversaries said,
we offend not, because they have sinned against the Lord.&nbsp;
Much these heathen cared about the Lord&mdash;and as to my
professing foes, I beg you will always recommend them to the
prophecy of Obadiah, it is but one chapter&mdash;but do point to
them from the 10th to the 16th verse.&nbsp; When such professors
come to you with a budget of scandal, just put your finger on
this text, as already quoted, and ask them the meaning of it:
&ldquo;Thou shalt not go up and down as a tale-bearer among my
people.&rdquo;&nbsp; And when you see them quite enjoy the
subject of censure and backbiting, shew them this text:
&ldquo;And dust shall be the Serpent&rsquo;s meat, for Ephraim
feedeth upon ashes.&rdquo;&nbsp; And when there are plenty around
your table, pouring out scandal in abundance, always turn to this
text&mdash;Isaiah 28, <a name="page40"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 40</span>&ldquo;For all tables are full of
vomit and filthiness; there is no place clean,&rdquo; &ldquo;and
this is the mess which dogs are fond of.&rdquo;&mdash;See 2 Peter
ii, ver. 22.&nbsp; This will be the best cure for scandal, and
will keep your heart stedfast in God&rsquo;s covenant; and
although dark may be the cloud on me at present, stay till the
Lord appears for me&mdash;Judge not my state or case <i>yet</i>;
this is not the time for passing an opinion.&mdash;Job&rsquo;s
friends erred in this work; they all three agreed to torment him,
because they thought he was an hypocrite, but you know how
mistaken they were.</p>
<p>This leads me to notice another insinuation, that
&ldquo;Surely J. C. is an hypocrite!&rdquo;&mdash;This is a most
frightful charge, and in general a common epithet cast upon
<i>all</i> those who profess religion; and as it is the
worldling&rsquo;s sneer, it is not worth notice.&nbsp; What I
really am in God&rsquo;s sight is best known to himself; and as
it respects my conversion, call, and ministry, I shall certainly
write it while I am here; and if the Lord ever raises up my head
again, I shall certainly publish it, for the magnifying that
grace which the Lord has so bountifully bestowed on me, and which
will give some satisfaction to my friends, and no doubt afford my
enemies a treat also.&nbsp; But, as it respects the subject of
hypocrisy, let my enemies tremble in reading this text:
&ldquo;Beware ye the leaven of the pharisees, which is
hypocrisy:&rdquo; they assumed the garb of sanctity, and
professed much love to the law; made a stir about external
holiness and charity, yet, inwardly, they were full of enmity,
spite, malice, and hatred to the truth.&nbsp; Deemed others as
Antinomians, or enemies to the law, while they were the worst
enemies to the law.&nbsp; An old author has pointed out
thirty-three kinds of hypocrites, <a name="page41"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 41</span>which I send you for your reflection;
and at the same time, knowing the deceitfulness of the human
heart, may we ever pray with David, &ldquo;Cleanse thou me from
my secret faults.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Arch Hypocrite is the Devil himself, and he is the father
of all the following children.&mdash;There is</p>
<p class="gutindent">The natural hypocrite.</p>
<p class="gutindent">The civil,</p>
<p class="gutindent">The moral,</p>
<p class="gutindent">The political,</p>
<p class="gutindent">The theatrical,</p>
<p class="gutindent">The heretical,</p>
<p class="gutindent">The schismatical,</p>
<p class="gutindent">The superstitious,</p>
<p class="gutindent">The ignorant,</p>
<p class="gutindent">The profane,</p>
<p class="gutindent">The counterfeit convert,</p>
<p class="gutindent">The worldly,</p>
<p class="gutindent">The religious,</p>
<p class="gutindent">The stinted,</p>
<p class="gutindent">The waxing,</p>
<p class="gutindent">The temporary,</p>
<p class="gutindent">The preaching,</p>
<p class="gutindent">The hearing hypocrite,</p>
<p class="gutindent">The praying,</p>
<p class="gutindent">The inspired,</p>
<p class="gutindent">The believing,</p>
<p class="gutindent">The hoping,</p>
<p class="gutindent">The fawning,</p>
<p class="gutindent">The repenting,</p>
<p class="gutindent">The fearing,</p>
<p class="gutindent">The patient,</p>
<p class="gutindent">The obedient,</p>
<p class="gutindent">The talking,</p>
<p class="gutindent">The idle,</p>
<p class="gutindent">The zealous,</p>
<p class="gutindent">The judging,</p>
<p class="gutindent">The libertine,</p>
<p class="gutindent">The scandalous.</p>
<p>It is an awful thing when a man deceives himself, and such,
alas, is the case with every unconverted character: but no
believer in Christ, who is made acquainted with the plague of his
own heart, but must lament the hypocrisy he daily feels within
himself; and must with joy and grief acknowledge with the truly
excellent <span class="smcap">Erskine</span>&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>I&rsquo;m <i>without</i> guile an Israelite,<br />
Yet like a guileful hypocrite,<br />
<a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>Maintaining truth in the inward part,<br />
With falsehood rooted in the heart.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And this is the holy Spirit&rsquo;s account of a pardoned and
justified man in Christ, in whose spirit there is no grille, yet
his nature makes him often sigh, O wretched man that I am!&nbsp;
I trust the ever blessed Spirit of all grace will most
effectually purge away my pride, self-will, stubbornness,
rebellion, and carelessness, according to his gracious promise:
&ldquo;And I will purge out the rebels from among
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; But this cannot be accomplished without deep
afflictions.&nbsp; You know the generally received
maxim&mdash;Violent maladies require violent remedies.</p>
<p>Another method the above persons adopt is to degrade my
ministry, by asserting that &ldquo;All I ever advanced was from
strength of memory.&rdquo;&nbsp; If this was the case, it is
certainly very much to my credit, that I was so much given to
study as to fill my mind with sufficient matter to preach so
often as I did, near thirty Sermons a month, for fourteen years,
and for these ten years past to the same people.&mdash;But you
shall hear what an envious preacher said in company, who has just
left us: &ldquo;Oh, as to C&rsquo;s religion and preaching, he
was generally running about with a parcel of gay young people,
till the last moment he had to come into the pulpit&mdash;and as
to Sermons, why he generally went into his study and learned a
Sermon by heart, and then came and preached it.&rdquo;&nbsp; This
is so palpable that it is not worth contradicting.&nbsp; How I
can be running about with gay young people till preaching time,
and at the same time be in my study, learning a Sermon by heart,
I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;and yet, would you believe <a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>it, this
contradiction was received by the company.&nbsp; Some people will
believe any thing but the truth; and it is no wonder God permits
them to be always in bondage about the minister they professed to
be blessed under.&nbsp; It was most justly remarked by a good
man, when gossips came to him with a story against his minister,
&ldquo;And pray has not the preacher one good
qualification&mdash;not <i>one</i>, that you can tell me of,
either as a man, a christian, a preacher, a husband, a father, or
a neighbour?&nbsp; Strange to tell, if he has not&mdash;and if he
has, would you call to tell me of that?&nbsp; I believe
not.&rdquo;&mdash;Dear Mrs. E. go thou, and do likewise.</p>
<p>As to the present prosecution, whether guilty or not, is not
the point; only it is necessary to remind you, the prosecution is
<i>not</i> for falling into the crime, but most explicitly for
(as they chuse to word it) an <i>intent</i> only.&nbsp; But
whether I was actually guilty or not, even of <i>that</i>, let
the prosecutor&rsquo;s own words settle it.&nbsp; He has
positively declared, that I was <i>not</i> guilty of any
indecorous act to him whatever.&mdash;Here I leave this subject
to your reflection, and conclude by observing to your last
remark, that you disapproved of an assertion of mine once in the
pulpit, namely, &ldquo;That if a child of God had not felt the
terrors of the Law yet, perhaps they would before their death,
and therefore it was right to expect, or look out for
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; God forbid that I should limit the Holy One of
Israel in his operations of grace in the hearts of his children,
but this I know, that very few of God&rsquo;s children has
escaped them, though at first they might have been allured into a
knowledge of Christ, yet they felt the storm on the road.&nbsp;
Abraham, David, Job, Heman, <a name="page44"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 44</span>Asaph, Hezekiah, and many others
found it, and so may you; it is best to be prepared by a
spiritual acquaintance with the Lord Jesus Christ, in his person,
work, love, offices, and promises.&nbsp; I thank you for your
faithfulness to me&mdash;he that rebuketh a wise man shall find
favour&mdash;and may a full free-grace reward be given thee of
the Lord God Almighty, under whose wing thou hast long
trusted.&nbsp; Pray for me, that I may be more wise for the
future, and more useful to God&rsquo;s family.&nbsp; And, O help
me to praise him, that I am still a bush burning, yet unconsumed,
because I am one.</p>

<p><span class="GutSmall">MY VERY DEAR FRIEND</span>,</p>
<p>I <span class="GutSmall">AM</span> anxious to hear how thy God
supports your mind under the afflictive
dispensation.&mdash;Little did I think that we should so speedily
lose one that was dear to us both&mdash;to me as a friend, and a
conscientious christian, but as every thing to you, next to God
and your own soul.&nbsp; But we shall meet again, where tears
shall be wiped from every eye, and parting shall be known no
more.&nbsp; My friend <i>I</i> shall recognize above, and
<i>you</i> will clasp your much-loved North again&mdash;</p>

there&rsquo;s a day when I shall<br />
Meet my friend.&nbsp; Meet him!<br />
Oh, transporting thought! and<br />
Together spend eternity itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ah, cruel death! thus so early to separate twin souls.&nbsp;
Why do I thus talk!&nbsp; Our beloved friend has escaped the head
ach, the heart ach, inbred corruption, an ensnaring world, a
tempting devil, wicked men, false professors, abounding error,
and weak-minded christians.&nbsp; What a glorious, painful
deliverance! blessed to him and distressing to us, more
particularly to you.&nbsp; I need say nothing about him&mdash;you
best knew his worth.&nbsp; I only lament my captivity, that I
could not attend him in his illness&mdash;that I could not see
the finishing work of grace on his heart&mdash;that I could not
with him, and by him, bend the knee, and commend him to his dear
Saviour, who was waiting to receive his dear elect, redeemed
soul.&nbsp; Those who live on the sea coast have seen armies
drawn up, in order to receive some great personage; so, truly
(could you and I look beyond this lower world) we should have
seen numbers of angels waiting to conduct your dear partner to
the land of eternal bliss.&nbsp; Yea, more, the dear Saviour
himself came for him&mdash;so he promises, I will come again, and
receive you to myself, that where I am there you may be also.</p>
<p>How very uncertain is life!&nbsp; Perhaps as I write this
short epistle, this hand may be checked, and mouth be dumb.&nbsp;
O may we be found in some sweet frame, or good work when death
appears.&nbsp; May we never be attacked in an ill-spent hour, but
be wrapt in holy thoughts, and clothed with the righteousness of
God our dear Saviour&mdash;pardoned by his precious blood, <a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>and on the
wings of love, ready to take our flight.&mdash;Death is certainly
very terrific to us, but it is our Father&rsquo;s porter, sent to
unlock mortality, to let out his prisoner to the full enjoyment
of his inheritance.&mdash;I pray God to grant we may both find
Christ so precious to us, that we may truly say with the apostle,
For me to live is Christ, and to die is gain&mdash;that is,
Christ is gain to me, whether I live or die.&nbsp; Our main
business is to cultivate an intimacy with Christ.&nbsp; I
remember when my heart was overcharged with grief, that I was
nearly distracted, there came to me a soft, still voice, as it
were, saying, &ldquo;Acquaint thyself with God, and be at peace
with him.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is the command, and God has promised
that he will give us an heart to know him; and has declared,
&ldquo;All thy children shall be taught of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; To
know God in Christ is eternal life, and this knowledge of him is
knowing him in an experimental way, as a God pardoning iniquity,
transgression, and sin.&nbsp; This, only this, can subdue the
fears of death, and take away its sting.</p>
<p>I often think of the dying saying of a good man, when asked,
as he was near death, whether he feared death, &ldquo;I cannot
say&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that I have so lived as not to fear
death, but I can say that I know Christ so, that I am not afraid
to die.&rdquo;&nbsp; I trust the Lord will support you in your
very trying circumstances&mdash;that his hand will preserve you
in your approaching calamity, and give you a safe
delivery&mdash;that almighty grace will save the child, that
parents and children may meet in glory.&nbsp; The Lord is well
known in Zion as an husband to the widow, and the father of the
fatherless, and he will be known by you in these lovely
characters.&nbsp; I had not an opportunity of dropping a tribute
of respect <a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>for your dear husband in the pulpit, I beg, however, the
Lord will be with you, and give you to enjoy all the grace
contained in this sweet text&mdash;&ldquo;For thy maker is thy
husband, the Lord of Hosts is his name.&rdquo;&nbsp; To him be
glory by the Church.&nbsp; Amen.</p>
<blockquote><p>Command me home, Oh God my King,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And bear me to the Skies,<br />
Where Angels loud Hosannahs sing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And drink celestial joys.</p>

<p style="text-align: right"><i>Valley of Achor</i>,
<i>February</i> 20<i>th</i>, 1818.</p>
<p>Mr. &amp; Mrs. P&mdash;<span class="GutSmall">N</span>.</p>
<p><span class="GutSmall">MY EVER DEAR FRIENDS IN THE BEST OF
BONDS</span>,</p>
<p>Grace and peace be your&rsquo;s.&mdash;I trust I need not
apologize for writing to you from such a place, and under such
circumstances.&nbsp; You will no doubt join me in saying, I am
just where the Lord had long devised I should be, and where, I
bless his dear name, he graciously condescends to pay me many a
visit, sometimes with a rod, and sometimes with a smile: and he
has promised both to us&mdash;he laid up the rod as well as the
manna in the ark, and it is only the sanctified rod, afflictions
in Christ, that can do us any lasting good.&nbsp; But I trust
that in my personal experience, the rod has budded in my
convictions of what I have done amiss in <a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>many things,
for says an inspired apostle, &ldquo;In many things we all
offend.&rdquo;&nbsp; I hope the rod has also blossomed in my
humility, and that the fruit will be peace and righteousness; and
as much preciseness in my whole conduct, as if my salvation
depended on it.&nbsp; I trust the long contention the Lord has
had with me, for these ten years past, is consummated.&nbsp; I
cannot bless God for distress of mind, but I can bless him for
that grace that melts the heart, and produces that secret sacred
mourning, wonder, gratitude, and peace.&nbsp; None but an
all-seeing Jehovah can tell what I have seen here; my grief has
been great, my sighs have been many, my heart has been broken,
sin has appeared detestable, error damnable, man truly depraved,
God patient, long suffering and good.&nbsp; I have been deeply
distrest on account of my own sins, and the sins of others.&nbsp;
O that this work had been as deep on my soul some years ago, as
it has been only some few months past, but, alas, I lived too far
off from
God&mdash;company&mdash;visits&mdash;bustle&mdash;noise&mdash;stir&mdash;clamour&mdash;and
levity of manners, light and trifling professors, and no power
given me sufficient to keep me on my guard.&nbsp; These stole my
time, attention, and talents; the spirit&rsquo;s operations were
not watched, the Saviour was slighted, and his dear company
shunned; established believers and deep taught favorites of the
most high were left, and I was in doubts what to do between
conscience and feelings, guided too much by the latter, and the
former got hardened.&nbsp; These and a thousand things more I
deeply regret; these try my spirit now, and though I have no
doubt they are pardoned, for I have tasted, felt, and handled
that blessing also in this place, yet I cannot, will not forgive
myself, while I live in the body.&nbsp; What the Lord is doing
with me, has puzzled many, <a name="page49"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 49</span>but he has not left me wholly in the
dark about it.&nbsp; As the great Head of the Church, he is
washing the feet of his disciples; digging and purging his
garden, pruning his trees, awaking the north wind, beating his
spices, snuffing his candles, trimming his lamps, trying his
gold, refining his silver, purging the dross, removing the
rubbish, descending in a cloud, and stripping me of
self-admiration, which is rank idolatry&mdash;and all this is in
covenant love.&nbsp; This is using the fan, and the sieve, and I
hope purging that away that can be well spared; and I can assure
my dear friends I am still praying over, and watching the
accomplishment of that sweet text in Zechariah, &ldquo;I will
bring the third part <i>through</i> the fire; I will try them as
gold is tried, and refine them as silver is refined: they shall
call on my name.&nbsp; I will say it is my people, and they shall
say, the Lord is my God, Selah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Lord tries our faith, by stirring up every thing in
opposition to us, yet enabling us to believe thro&rsquo;
all.&nbsp; He tries our love, by leading us to see the awful
errors that abound in the world, in opposition to the most
blessed Redeemer; and by sometimes hiding his face.&nbsp; He
tries our hope, by permitting Satan to assault us on every
hand.&nbsp; He tries our patience, by delays to answer our
prayers, by the length of our afflictions, and by their
aboundings.&nbsp; Thus he tries us, and then he most graciously
gives us an opportunity of trying him.&nbsp; We try his love, and
find it the same every hour.&nbsp; We try his power, and find it
supports and cheers us.&nbsp; We try his word, and find it
precious.&nbsp; We try his obedience, death, and intercession,
and find it brings a lasting peace to the soul.&nbsp; We try his
truth and faithfulness, and find that firm all the way <a
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>to
heaven!&nbsp; We try his long suffering, by our daily
provocations; and we try his mercy, and find it kind.&nbsp; His
grace, and find it sovereign, rich, and free.&nbsp; Thus the Lord
deals with us, and we with him.</p>
<p>These things I have found, felt, and known, and hope, through
abounding goodness, yet to proclaim to others, perhaps not more
faithfully than I have, but I hope more simply and clearly.&nbsp;
I want the divine spirit to lead me deeply into all truths, for
the knowledge and purity of God&rsquo;s people&rsquo;s minds and
consciences, and to follow after righteousness in every
sense&mdash;peace and joy as the happy consequence.&nbsp; I have
no doubt but this trial is for my present salvation, in many
senses, but I am afraid of every thing&mdash;Satan has desired to
have me, but you can guess the cause why not, &ldquo;I have
prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>LETTER XV.</h2>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Valley of Achor</i>, <i>Jan.</i>
11, 1818.</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jones</span>.</p>
<p><span class="GutSmall">MY MUCH BELOVED BROTHER</span>,</p>
<p>I thank you for your kind letter, it was more than a mite cast
into the gospel treasury, as every kind word and kind action is
doubly sweet when a person is in deep trouble; I have often
thought of poor Job, when he cried out in the real bitterness of
his heart, &ldquo;Have pity upon me, O my friends, for the hand
of God hath <a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>touched me.&rdquo;&nbsp; But above all, I have at times
thought of him who said, &ldquo;Lover and friend hast thou put
away from me.&rdquo;&mdash;(88th Psalm).&nbsp; Ah! he was
forsaken that we might never be forsaken&mdash;he was bound for
our liberty&mdash;chastised for our peace&mdash;suffered for our
comfort&mdash;died for our life&mdash;and lives that sin might
die, and our souls might be with him&mdash;<i>he toiled for our
ease</i>, <i>and for our safety bled</i>.&nbsp; Need I tell you
who I mean?&nbsp; <i>Him</i>, being delivered for our offences,
him hath God exalted.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sir, if ye have borne him
hence, tell me where ye have laid him.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We hid
our faces from him, yet we did esteem him&mdash;the bond of our
peace was upon Him, the Lord hath laid on him the iniquities of
us all.&nbsp; Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him, he hath put
him to grief&mdash;therefore will I divide him a portion with the
great.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Saw ye him whom my soul loveth?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I sought him, but I found him not&mdash;I will seek him, I
found him, I held him, and would not let him go until I had
brought him into my brother&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;&nbsp; Need I
mention his name?&nbsp; It would not be half so sweet, as if you
were on a journey, or accidentally fell in company with one that
loved him, and over-heard his dear name mentioned by a stranger,
in a very sweet and savory way: how it would open your ears, lead
out your love, and quicken your soul.&nbsp; &ldquo;His name is
Jesus! for he shall save his people from their sins.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But this could not be, without his acting as a substitute for
them, and this he has done.&nbsp; He first indemnified his
people, and then gave himself up to the justice of God.&nbsp; Ah,
little did his enemies think what was in the heart of Jesus when
he gave himself up to them, and said, &ldquo;If ye seek me, let
these go their way.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was acting over what he had
engaged to do in eternity, when the adorable Father called him
forth to act for <a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
52</span>the dear people of his charge.&nbsp; Considering them in
the fallen state, as sinners, justice looked to him for
satisfaction, and millions were saved upon the ground of his
covenant engagement; his vast mind took in the nature of sin,
with all its deserts, and he engaged to become a sin-offering, to
bear all our guilt, to stand in our place, in the
malefactor&rsquo;s cloaths, and to endure all that we had
deserved.&nbsp; O my brother, how we shall love him when we see
him in all his glory, in heaven; but is it not very lamentable,
that sin in us should so chain us down to earth and self, that we
can but seldom rise to God, and never without sin, <i>evil is
ever present</i>.&nbsp; I feel at times its influence so deeply
as I cannot describe to any one&mdash;to me, it is as trying as
St. Paul&rsquo;s thorn in the flesh.&nbsp; I humbly conceive that
good man was perpetually buffeted to curse God, but what I feel
is different, and yet so horrible I cannot tell anyone on
earth.&nbsp; O my grief, how great it is on this subject, and if
it is Satan&rsquo;s influence, what a cruel Devil he must be, to
harrass in this present affliction, but I am a sinner, and the
Lord will make me feel it.&nbsp; I have too much given way to
Satan, and now he is set at me like a bull-dog, or as a gaping
lion, ready to devour me&mdash;my faith is weak and my fears are
strong.&nbsp; I want the strength and vigor of faith in exercise,
to carry me above present feelings, and present troubles; but as
sinners, I believe God will make us most heartily sick of sin,
especially our most easy besetment, shall be the principal pull
that Satan and the world will ever trouble us with.&nbsp; Thus I
find nothing can subdue sin but communion with Christ, maintained
and kept up by our union with him.&nbsp; The mind must be
powerfully led by the holy spirit, to contemplate what Christ is
to us, and as we are kept near to him, sin cannot get the
mastery.&nbsp; A <a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
53</span>daily cross galls the old man, and imbitters Life, but a
view of Jesus, accompanied with power, subdues sin&mdash;that
which pardons sin subdues it.&nbsp; This is what we want, and all
our neglect of Christ, is punished by Satan&rsquo;s stirring up
sin, seducing us into it, and then turning accuser, and a court
adversary.&nbsp; But I apprehend the Lord has but one grand
object in view, and that is to lead us to Jesus only.&nbsp; The
troubles of Life wean us from the world; the weakness of
God&rsquo;s children, and their faults, keep us from idolizing
the very best of them.&nbsp; Sin within us keeps us from settling
in the flesh, while the temptations of the devil urge us
constantly to make Christ our refuge.&nbsp; Thus the Lord
over-rules all for us, and, as an all-wise physician, he
compounds all our conflicts, to make us like himself, by being a
partaker of his holiness.&nbsp; Every day&rsquo;s experience
proves to us the value of Jesus, as God-Man Mediator&mdash;as our
atoning sacrifice, and everlasting justification before
God.&nbsp; As our head and representative&mdash;our intercessor
and advocate&mdash;as the blessed maintainer of his own
work&mdash;and as engaged to help, protect, bless, and bring us
home to glory.</p>
<p>I know not what the Lord intends to do with me, and when he is
precious to my soul I do not care what he does with me.&nbsp; I
have then no will of my own.&nbsp; I neither want to preach or be
silent, leave this place or abide in it, that is no trouble to me
then&mdash;but when nature, sin, sorrow, and Satan trouble me, I
feel like a wild Bull in a net.&nbsp; At times I feel
compunction, godly sorrow, and self-abasement: this is the lowest
seat in the College of Christ.&nbsp; Here is safety; but, alas,
even these we may be proud of, so that we really get weaned from
frames and feelings, and rejoice that <a name="page54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>Jesus is the same.&nbsp; Hence the
command, Rejoice in the Lord always.&nbsp; He is always the
object of faith, hope, love, and joy; our feelings are not,
though we highly esteem them&mdash;nor can we rest without some
sensations of joy in the Lord&mdash;I trust the Saviour will be
precious to your mind; keep you near himself; and when sin is
striving for the mastery, you may have grace given to call on the
Lord&mdash;<i>and be sure to cry out before you are hurt</i>, for
you may not be able when the hurt comes; for such is the nature
of sin, that, like the leprosy of old, it is of a deadening
nature; it makes the guilty stupid, till God is pleased to
quicken us again; and when we feel the wounds sin has made, we
want the Saviour to heal us again, which he kindly does.</p>

<h2>LETTER XVI.</h2>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Valley of Achor</i>,
<i>December</i> 17<i>th</i>, 1817.</p>
<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hutchings</span>.</p>
<p><span class="GutSmall">MY DEAR MOTHER</span>,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">For</span> such has been your affection
and concern for me, which I trust will never go unrewarded by the
dear Saviour.&nbsp; Many have been the attempts to keep you from
attending my feeble ministry, to hurt your mind, to distress your
spirit, and to perplex your heart, but having obtained help of
God you continue <a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>to this day, only grieved that my enemies have at last
gained that end they have been so long aiming at, and because you
cannot make me as comfortable in my captivity as your heart
desires.&nbsp; The Lord takes the will for the deed in the hearts
of those who desire to fear his name, revere his truth, love the
Saviour, trust his word, and hope in his finished work.&nbsp;
This I trust is the case of the dear friend to whom I now
write.&nbsp; This is an act of free favour from a good and
gracious God, and where these things are to be found, the Spirit
has begun a work he will never leave or forsake.&nbsp; May it be
clearer to your mind, more powerful upon your heart, more evident
to your faith, and produce in your soul such a hope as will never
fail, till you see God in glory.</p>
<p>I have often intended to call on you, and talk of these sweet
things, because you wished me so to do, and because God had given
to your mind an humble desire to know Christ, and be found in
him.&nbsp; But a continued scene of bustle all day, and too
frequently in company with my enemies, which I now deeply
lament.&nbsp; This hindered me; and sometimes, at night, I was
weary <i>in</i>, though not <i>with</i> my work, that I needed
rest, so then Satan stopt me; but I shall be happy to talk with
you now by letter, and perhaps it will be much better than our
conversation might have been, because you can read another time
what you might not have remembered in talk.&nbsp; I hope never to
grow weary of reminding my dear friends of that one thing that is
truly needful, the experimental knowledge of Christ.&nbsp; The
tidings of the Gospel are very simple, being only a declaration
that God the Father, Son, and Spirit, as the God of love,
purposed to glorify <a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>each other; in the everlasting happiness of a number
that no man can number&mdash;and methinks I hear you say, I would
give ten thousand worlds, at times, to know if I am among that
number.&nbsp; The Lord, I hope, will make that clear to you
soon.&nbsp; Each adorable person in the Trinity, agreed to take
names, suited to the offices they would sustain in the business
of our salvation.&nbsp; One adorable person condescended to take
the name of Father&mdash;the dearest, the most familiar, the
sweetest name&mdash;and as he appeared in that character, he
called forth the second adorable person, as Mediator; and after
proposing to him another nature, besides his God-head, he became
the elect head of all his dear family, who appeared in his mind,
just as they will be in the resurrection&mdash;truly
glorious.&nbsp; I hope Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hutchings</span>
was seen among the brilliant throng.&nbsp; But for the greater
displays of grace, God permitted this happy number to fall into
sin, with all the dreadful consequences that should attend such a
fall.&nbsp; Upon the fore-sight of this, the dear Son of God was
called, and he graciously consented to come down into this world,
to stand in our stead, to take our place, to obey the law which
we had broken, and which obedience of his, was to be reckoned
ours.&nbsp; Yes my dear friend, this text has often gladdened my
heart.&nbsp; &ldquo;But to us it shall be imputed, who believe in
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; O what a comfort, our dear Lord not only obeyed
the Law, but he endured the penalty of it, which was all that was
implied in the &ldquo;<i>Curse of God</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; But dear
Lord, what did <i>that</i> imply; no heart can conceive, no
tongue can ever describe it&mdash;his heart melted like wax, his
dear knees trembled, his spirit was filled with anguish, and his
whole soul felt the pangs of the damned&mdash;the sufferings of
his dear, his sacred body were dreadful, <a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>but the
sufferings of his soul, were the very soul of his
sufferings.&nbsp; O what must sin be&mdash;may we see it as a
most dreadful evil, and those who make a mock at sin mock the
Saviour&rsquo;s bitter anguish.&nbsp; He died, but in dying he
satisfied the justice of God, and the Father has declared himself
well pleased, quite satisfied with his work.&nbsp; God can now be
holy, yet save an unholy sinner; he can be just, and yet justify
an ungodly creature; he can be God, and yet pardon the very
vilest.&nbsp; The work is done, it was for sinners Jesus
died&mdash;then sure I hope he died for thee.&nbsp; In this hope
I trust you will live, not upon what you may ever feel, that may
encourage you, but entirely upon the work of Christ.&nbsp; May
this simple testimony encourage you to pray in spirit, when you
have but few words, or perhaps, like Hannah, no words to say; yet
your spirit I hope will be often going up to God, the holy and
ever blessed Spirit, who also engaged in the same agreement with
the Father and the Son, that he would assume such offices for
those for whom the Redeemer died.&nbsp; That he would shew them
their need of Jesus, that he would enlighten them, so that they
might see Christ was exactly suited for them; that he would help
them to call upon him, to run to him when stung with guilt; that
he would enable them to hope in his person, to trust in his work,
to love his name, his gospel, his people, and his ways; to wait
on him in secret and in public, till be graciously shewed them
their interest in Christ, and the interest Christ has in
them.&nbsp; That he would give them honourable thoughts of Jesus,
and enable them to rejoice that Jesus has precious thoughts of
them.&nbsp; This is the work of the blessed Spirit, and if my
dear Friend desires this work on the heart to live and die with,
I must beg her to take every <a name="page58"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 58</span>opportunity to entreat this divine
Spirit to work these things in the mind, according to his
promise, &ldquo;I will write my laws in their minds, I will be
merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins I will remember
no more.&rdquo;&nbsp; Let me beg of you, when you have got
through this letter, to read the thirteen first verses of the
eleventh chapter of Luke, and if you ever do me the honour to
read this side of my letter again, and can make it out very
easily, always read the same verses again.</p>
<p>God bless you&mdash;when I write to one, I write to you
both.&nbsp; Kind respects to all the family.</p>

<h2>LETTER XVII.</h2>
<p>From M. C. to her Father.</p>
<p><span class="GutSmall">DEAR FATHER</span>,</p>
<p>I write merely to inform you I am still at our kind
Friend&rsquo;s, Mr. P. he has left town for a few days, and Mrs.
P. says she will not spare me till his return.&nbsp; Last Sunday
morning we went to hear the Rev. Mr. E. whose chapel is in D.
Street, near the Foundling; he certainly preached a most
excellent sermon, upon &ldquo;<i>I am the Life</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp;
You have been informed that he denies the existence of the Lord
Jesus Christ from eternity, but he fully proved that Christ was
the <a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span>lasting life of his people, and that his church was in
him before the foundation of the world.&nbsp; He shewed us that
Christ was the head of his people, that he was their life of
justification, their spiritual and their eternal life.&nbsp; I
assure you he did not rob the Saviour of his glory, but aimed to
extol him as far as I could understand the subject.&nbsp; I think
for humility in the pulpit, he exceeds every minister I ever
heard; he has laid down his carriage to do good, which, I think,
shews a christian spirit; and if he holds any error, I think if
ministers were to go to him, and reason with, and pray for him,
it would be more becoming them than opposing him.&mdash;In the
evening we came over to our own chapel, and was much gratified to
see every thing at the Sacrament conducted with so much good
order in your absence, by Mr. Park, who, though not a very great,
is a very good man.&nbsp; There were a great number of
Communicants, and a good congregational&mdash;all appeared
solid.&nbsp; Pray father do not let any worthless character
administer the ordinance, as I think it very presumptuous for a
man, apparently destitute of grace, to say at the Lord&rsquo;s
Table, &ldquo;I take this cup, in the fullest confidence that I
shall drink the new wine in the kingdom of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
have just written to my dear Aunt, to inform her I shall stay a
week longer here, as I am very comfortable.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">I remain, dear Father,<br />

<p style="text-align: right"><i>Achor&rsquo;s Vale</i>,
<i>January</i> 1, 1819.</p>
<p>To my Daughter.</p>
<p><span class="GutSmall">MY DEAR GIRL</span>,</p>
<p>Agreeable to your request I have not read your letter to any
one, but without your permission, I shall take the liberty to let
many read it themselves.&nbsp; I know you will not thank me for
it, but I hope others will, for the truths you have given me an
opportunity of stating, in opposition to those awful heresies,
which so awfully abound in the present day of general
profession.&nbsp; I am well pleased that the Lord has been so far
gracious to you, as to give you an attentive ear, a degree of
light, an humble desire after the favour of God, and a sense of
your interest in the dear Redeemer.&nbsp; These things,
accompanied with a tender conscience, are most blessed
signs&mdash;they are the buds, which I hope will blossom and bear
fruit to the glory of God.&nbsp; But here you must not rest, the
command is, &ldquo;Go forward, and you shall know, as you follow
on to know the Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; Seek him earnestly, diligently,
fervently&mdash;never rest till you find him&mdash;eternal life
is in him, and all that hate him love sin and death.&nbsp; Do not
rest on any good desires, but on the object desired; this desire
accomplished you will find sweet to the soul; follow hard after
Jesus, and you will find him your God, your portion, your heaven,
your all.&nbsp; And what a consolation to me will it be, that the
Lord remembered you, or any of my dear children.&nbsp; I would
endure many years privation as I now do, if I could obtain that
blessing for you all, or for only one.&nbsp; A good woman in
Scotland once said she had borne nine <a name="page61"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>children, with great pain of body,
and she would bear them all again for their eternal
salvation.&nbsp; Although it is not of him that willeth, nor of
him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy, yet every means
must be used, as much as if salvation depended on them.</p>
<blockquote><p>&rsquo;Twill save you from a thousand snares,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; To feel religion young;<br />
Grace will preserve your growing years,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And glory crown the song.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Remember, my dear girl, while seeking the Lord&mdash;Father,
Son, and Spirit&mdash;angels, saints, and good men&mdash;all the
perfections and all the promises of God, are on your side.</p>
<p>But with respect to your account of Mr. E.&nbsp; I am not at
all satisfied with it; his humility may be admired in a few
external self denials, but his putting down his carriage as an
act of humility is nothing, if he at the same time disdains the
golden bottom of Solomon&rsquo;s chariot, of the wood of Lebanon,
( 3rd chapter Solomon&rsquo;s Song) the essential and eternal
divinity of the Lord Jesus Christ&mdash;as Jehovah&mdash;as one
in the divine essence&mdash;the self-existent and independent
God.&nbsp; This is the glorious and alone foundation of the
Church; and if Christ is not this adorable person, the angels in
heaven must be guilty of rank idolatry, the Church will be lost,
and I must sink under the curse of God.&nbsp; For all the angelic
hosts adore him, the Church is built upon him, and I am trusting
in him.&nbsp; For thus saith the Lord, &ldquo;Cursed is man that
trusteth in man, and maketh flesh his arm.&rdquo;&nbsp; And if
Christ is not God in the highest sense of the word, woe be to all
who trust in him.&nbsp; But the scriptures are plain and positive
<a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>upon this
subject, for <i>blessed are all they that put their trust in
him</i>.&nbsp; The gentleman whom you heard preach so many
precious truths, I can say nothing about without hearing him
myself; he may possess much humility, but if his heart has never
been humbled by the grace of God, to bow to the testimony which
God, Father, Son, and Spirit has given of Christ, his humility is
not a grace, of the holy Spirit&rsquo;s working, and all the good
he may do to the bodies of the poor, yet if he is circulating
poison to the soul, what will it avail them.&nbsp; No doubt some
good men have reasoned with him, and I hope prayed for him, that
God would bring into the way of truth, all such as have erred and
are deceived.&nbsp; I have been informed that he is nothing but
an Arian in his sentiments or views of Christ, and however
clearly he may declare some of the grand calvinistic truths of
the gospel, it is but building a castle in the air, as the great
doctrines have no other basis, than the self-existence of the
adorable Redeemer, and if this foundation be removed, what can
the righteous do?&nbsp; The Atheist and the Sadducee are trying
to remove this foundation, by denying an hereafter, or a world to
come.&nbsp; The Deist is employed in the same work, by ridiculing
the Scriptures.&nbsp; The Arminian hates the doctrine of
justification by the righteousness of Christ, imputed to
faith.&nbsp; The Socinian declares Christ is but a mere
man.&nbsp; The Libertine sins that grace may abound.&nbsp; The
Sabellians, and the new Jerusalem folks, as they,
themselves&mdash;these deny the Personality, and, of course, the
Divinity of the Father and the holy Spirit; and the deluded Arian
denies the essential Divinity of the Son of God.&nbsp; Thus the
Devil has employed these labourers to remove God&rsquo;s
foundation&mdash;to leave us without God, and like Satan himself,
without hope.</p>
<p><a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>But
blessed be God for that faith which embraces the grand truth of
the sacred pages; that there are three which bear record in
heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost, and these three
are one.&nbsp; The glorious record that each adorable person
bears, is to the Divinity of Christ, as God over all, blessed for
ever.&nbsp; Hear what the Father says of Christ, &ldquo;Thy
throne, O God, is for ever and ever.&rdquo;&nbsp; Hear what the
Saviour says, &ldquo;Look unto me, and be ye saved, all ye ends
of the earth, for I am God, and there is none else.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Hear also the testimony of the holy Spirit, &ldquo;And his name
shall be called wonderful counsellor&mdash;the mighty
God.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Arian does indeed admit, that Christ is
God, but then it is only in a subordinate sense&mdash;only a God,
by delegation and office.&nbsp; But then, this is making two
Gods&mdash;one supreme, and the other subordinate, and to worship
any thing below infinite divinity, is awful idolatry, for all men
must honour the Son, as they honour the Father&mdash;&ldquo;Thou
shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou
serve.&rdquo;&nbsp; Angels and saints are commanded to adore and
worship him, &ldquo;Let all the angels of God worship him, for he
is thy Jehovah, and worship thou him.&rdquo;&mdash;It is
certainly curious to see the Arian strutting about with this
text, in 17th John, &ldquo;This is life eternal to know the only
true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.&rdquo;&nbsp; But
when you remind him of 1st John, 5th chapter, 20th verse, he
shrinks back, crying out, it is doubtful whether that part is
inspired, And we know that the Son of God is come&mdash;this is
the true God, and our eternal life; for if the Father is the true
God, so also is Christ.&nbsp; Nothing proves this point so
clearly as the glorious and incommunicable name of Jehovah, given
him, as at once expressive of his underived independent <a
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>self-existent
Deity, as one in the adorable Godhead.&nbsp; But this subject
would fill a volume of immense size.&nbsp; Let me bring to your
view, a few out of the many glorious testimonies given in the
Bible, and by comparing scripture with scripture, you will
through grace see their beauty, Isaiah viii, 13, 14, Sanctify the
Lord of Hosts himself, and let him be your fear and your dread,
and he shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling,
and a rock of offence to both the houses of Israel.&nbsp; See how
the apostle Peter explains this text, and applies it to his Lord.
1st Peter, ii, 7, 8.&nbsp; Isaiah vi, 5, Mine eyes have seen the
king, the Lord of Hosts.&nbsp; See how this belongs to Christ,
John xii, 41.&nbsp; Isaiah xliv, 6, Thus saith the Lord, the king
of Israel and his Redeemer, the Lord of Hosts&mdash;I am the
first, and I am the last, and besides me there is no God.&nbsp;
See Revelations xxii, 13.&nbsp; Isaiah iv, 3, 11, I, even I am
the Lord, and besides me there is no Saviour; and Peter stiles
him our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ.&nbsp; Psalm lxxviii, 56,
They tempted and provoked the most high God.&nbsp; 1st
Corinthians, x, 9, Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them
also tempted him.&nbsp; John iii, 29, He that hath the bride, is
the bridegroom.&nbsp; Isaiah, liv, 5, For thy Maker is thy
husband, the Lord of Hosts is his name.&nbsp; Psalm 23, Jehovah
is my shepherd.&nbsp; John x, 16, There shall be one fold and one
shepherd.&nbsp; John xx, 28, And Thomas said my Lord and my
God.&nbsp; Romans ix, 5, Of whom, as concerning the flesh, Christ
came, who is over all, God, blessed for ever.&nbsp; Psalm 100,
Know ye that the Lord he is God, and we are the people of his
pasture.&nbsp; John x, He, Christ, calleth his own sheep by
name.&nbsp; Feed my sheep, saith Christ to Peter.&nbsp; Feed the
flock of God said Peter.&nbsp; Collosians ii, 8, For in <a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>him dwelleth
all the fulness of the Godhead, bodily.&nbsp; And this is his
name whereby he shall be called&mdash;Jehovah our
righteousness.&nbsp; Why callest thou me good, there is none good
but one, that is God.&mdash;And his name shall be called The
mighty God.&nbsp; Revel, i, 8.&nbsp; I am Alpha and Omega, the
beginning and the ending, which is, which was, and which is to
come&mdash;the Almighty.</p>
<p>I could quote a vast number more grand passages, to shew you
that Christ is equal with the Father, one in the undivided
essence, the object of worship, possessed of every divine
perfection, the way to God, the suitable Saviour of his church,
and the glory of God, angels, and saints; but these are enough
one would think, to convince any reasonable being, but such,
alas, is human depravity, that nothing short of almighty power
can give faith to believe the record which God has given of his
Son.&nbsp; In these few texts, our adorable Jesus is called the
Lord of Hosts, the mighty God, Jehovah, God over all; my God, the
most high God, and the Almighty; and if the testimony of a worm
might be added&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>That Christ is God I can avouch,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And for his people cares,<br />
For I have pray&rsquo;d to him as such,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And he has heard my prayers.</p>

Saviour.</p>

<p style="text-align: right"><i>Achor&rsquo;s Vale</i>,
<i>September</i> 1, 1818.</p>
<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Davies</span>,</p>
<p><span class="GutSmall">MY VERY DEAR FRIEND</span>,</p>
<p>I fear my nerves will scarcely permit me to drop you a few
lines.&nbsp; What a day have I passed through!&nbsp; Solemn
period, but I hope blissful one to the unhappy, happy men.&nbsp;
No doubt you felt for me exceedingly, knowing how near to me the
late events would occur.&nbsp; On Sunday our worthy Chaplain
preached the condemned sermon, I choose rather to call it their
coronation sermon, as he then gave a most, affecting, but blessed
account of their state, and looking round upon a weeping
congregation, he begged leave to use the words of his master, on
a very affecting occasion, &ldquo;Daughters of Jerusalem, weep
for yourselves, not me.&rdquo;&nbsp; The poor men who were
condensed to die, wanted no pity, they had obtained mercy, they
now only needed the prayers of God&rsquo;s people, for his
upholding hand, his supporting power, and his soul-comforting
presence, at the last, the solemn, the affecting moment of their
dissolution.&nbsp; I am informed they had <a
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>it, but as I
have not yet had the particulars of their conversion and happy
death from any spiritual person, I cannot write you to that
effect, but as soon as I can possibly gain the account, I will
send it to you, knowing your heart will, and does leap for joy,
at the real conversion of any sinner, but especially those who
were so near death and eternity.&nbsp; I hope the account will be
well authenticated.&nbsp; This morning, Monday, I awoke early,
and was enabled to pour out strong cries and supplications to
God, for the poor men, that they might feel the joys of
salvation, as they approached their painful end.&nbsp; At seven
o&rsquo;clock the solemn church-bell tolled; but at eight
o&rsquo;-clock, all my powers were affected by the chapel bell
answering it.&nbsp; I knew then the procession was begun, I knew
then the subject was real, every stroke of the church bell seemed
to say, <i>Come</i>! and every sound of the chapel bell
responsed, <i>We come</i>!&nbsp; <i>We come</i>!&nbsp; I felt
every sound at my heart, and it again brought me on my knees in
earnest prayer, that a dear Saviour would meet them at the place
of execution.&nbsp; They arrived about an hour after on the
place; I could not see them, but I heard nearly all that
passed.&nbsp; The first sound was singing, I judged it was the
lamentation of a sinner, one verse, and which I think comprehends
every thing at once.</p>
<blockquote><p>Mercy, good Lord, mercy I ask&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the total sum,<br />
For mercy, Lord, is all my suit,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lord let that mercy come.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This prayer will suit the holiest believer, living and
dying.&nbsp; After a pause, as I judged, everything was preparing
for the awful stroke.&nbsp; I heard one of them pray, but not
being near enough I could not distinguish <a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>his
words.&nbsp; As he drew to a close I heard the fatal drop fall
which launched them into the presence of God.&nbsp; I burst into
tears, yea I thought my heart would have broke.&nbsp; I could
only then dart up ejaculatory prayers that the Lord Jesus would
receive their departing spirits.&nbsp; But grief overpowered me
all the day; I could not lift up my head with any pleasure.&nbsp;
I was pensive and distressed.&nbsp; A multitude of very affecting
ideas floated on my mind, and grief and gratitude took their
several turns; but I am as well as can be expected after so
severe a shock.&nbsp; I only fear a revival of sorrow on Sunday,
when I sit in view of the spot where I last saw them.&nbsp; Glad
shall I be to send you some good account of them in my next.</p>
<p>On the evening previous to the execution, I read part of the
solemn funeral service of the Church, and expounded to the
prisoners in this class, the 15th of the first of
Corinthians.&nbsp; The subject of the Resurrection was very
interesting, and my mind was devoutly engaged for some time with
the chapter.&nbsp; I had occasion, for the first time I believe,
to expatiate on that singular verse, 29, Else what shall they do
who are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not?&mdash;The
passage would receive some easier comment if rendered <i>over</i>
the dead, as Greek critics will allow, it being customary for the
primitive christians to baptize their proselytes over the graves
of the believing dead.&nbsp; This is the way some learned men
make it out.&nbsp; The plain matter of fact is, that superstition
had began to encroach on the simplicity of the Gospel, even in
Paul&rsquo;s days, and many ignorantly supposed that the
ordinance of Baptism was inseparably connected with the pardon of
Sin.&nbsp; From this mistaken notion, many <a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>postponed
their Baptism till their last moments; the consequence of which
was, many dying suddenly were not baptized at all&mdash;their
superstitious relatives imagined it would be an act of charity to
the dead to be baptized for them, in their name and stead,
begging of God at the same time, to accept the Baptism of the
proxy, as though it had been administered to the principal.&nbsp;
Hence others translate the passage, What shall they do who are
baptized <i>for</i>, or instead of the dead.&nbsp; But if the
dead rise not again this imaginary labour of love can answer no
valuable end.&nbsp; Why then do you doubt the Resurrection of the
dead?</p>
<p>May God the Holy Spirit quicken our souls into the enjoyment
of the favour of God, the knowledge of our pardon and
justification in Christ, and enable us to bring forth the fruits
of the Spirit, is the earnest prayer of</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Blinkinsop</span>,</p>
<p><span class="GutSmall">MY MOST AFFECTIONATE FRIEND</span>,</p>
<p>Can I ever forget your concern, good wishes, prayers, and
endeavours for my best interest?&nbsp; You have carefully watched
for my good as a Sister, felt for me as a Mother, and done me all
the good you could as a Christian.&nbsp; May God most kindly
reward you, and if not in this world, in temporal things, he <a
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>will own you
in that day when he shall make up his jewels&mdash;and never will
he let your dear children, perhaps, go unrewarded.&nbsp; He will
be a God to you and a Guardian to them.</p>
<p>I hear you think of going into the country this summer, if so
I shall not be favored with a visit for a long time.&nbsp; I hope
you will not go, but that I must leave to your better
judgement.&nbsp; I have been very much cast down since I last saw
you, nor do I expect to be much otherwise.&nbsp; When we walk
contrary to God, we know that he will walk contrary to us; but he
has most kindly declared that when the heart is humbled, he will
appear to our joy.&nbsp; I find the third chapter of the
Lamentations of Jeremiah very sweet to me at times, it is worth
your reading, as it is so suitable to my case and state, and no
doubt you will find it good to read it very often; the former
part no doubt belongs to Christ&mdash;he was the man that had
seen affliction, by the rod of God&rsquo;s wrath, and it is well
for us that he bore that for us, or else we must have borne it
for ever, in that place where hope never comes.&nbsp; You have
found him a good and gracious Saviour.&nbsp; He has helped you in
many a need.&nbsp; He has delivered you in many a trouble.&nbsp;
He has enabled you to believe in him, to love him as he is set
forth in the Gospel, a Saviour.&nbsp; He is well calculated to be
a Saviour, as he is God with God.&nbsp; He loved our nature so
well that he chose it in preference to the angels, though we had
sinned worse than they did&mdash;yet such was his love for us
that he gave himself for us.&nbsp; He lived an holy life of
obedience for us, which the adorable Father imputes to us for our
justification, while the ever blessed Spirit opens our blind
eyes, and gives <a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
71</span>us to see, and feel our need of that righteousness;
having none of our own fit to appear before God in, we need it,
believe in it, trust in it, and hope to be saved by it.&nbsp; O
my dear, kind friend! may you and I be better acquainted with
God&rsquo;s love in providing such a way for a poor sinner to be
saved.&nbsp; May we have a stronger faith, a larger mind and
affections, to receive Christ as he is revealed in the
Word.&nbsp; The Bible reveals Christ to us, but the Spirit must
reveal Christ in us.&nbsp; We are poor guilty creatures, and need
pardon for all sin.&nbsp; He has shed his blood to make
atonement&mdash;a satisfaction for sin, and having died for our
sin, he is gone to heaven to present his Person and his Work to
God for us.&nbsp; He is interceding there&mdash;he ever lives to
plead our cause, to conquer our enemies, to carry on the work of
salvation, to hear our prayers, to watch over us in our sorrows,
to support us in our calamity, to deliver us, in his own time and
way, and finally to bring us home to glory&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>There we shall see his face,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And never, never sin;<br />
There, from the rivers of his grace,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Drink endless pleasures in.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There we may meet to celebrate the riches of divine grace, and
experience the joys of that friendship, which is only begun in
this world, but is often sadly interrupted by sin and sorrow.</p>
<p>Fearing you will leave town, I thought it right to drop this
token of my most sincere regard and gratitude.&nbsp; May every
good be thine, and God be glorified in our eternal
salvation.&nbsp; What is there in this <a name="page72"></a><span

for?&mdash;it is full of changes, trials, and sorrow.&nbsp; May
we come up out of the wilderness, leaning on the beloved, longing
to get home, and daily dying to all the world.&nbsp; Getting
better acquainted with Jesus, by the teachings of the Holy
Spirit.&nbsp; I feel at times very much deprest indeed, but have
no doubt but that all things will work for good, and,</p>

before long,<br />
And then, O how pleasant the conqueror&rsquo;s song.</p>

<i>Dec.</i> 6, 1818.</p>
<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Darby</span>,</p>
<p><span class="GutSmall">MY DEAR SISTER IN THE LORD</span>,</p>
<p>I have read your letter, with sacred pleasure, containing an
account of the Lord&rsquo;s gracious dealings with your
soul.&nbsp; I wish every member of the Church would write me
something of their experience, that I might judge of their state,
for, as experience worketh hope, when we know a person&rsquo;s
experience we can judge of their hope.&nbsp; It is the custom of
some Churches, when persons are admitted, to give in a <a
name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>written
experience; this is a good custom, as many people are too timid
to appear and speak of the dealings of God with them, in the
whole face of an assembly, not that they are ashamed of the work
of God upon them, but they may be naturally timid.&nbsp; I have
always endeavoured to be as familiar to those who come to me
about spiritual things as I could, with any propriety, and even
that has been attended with a disadvantage, as the enemy has
turned <i>that</i> against one.&nbsp; I wish I could never speak
to any but the Lord&rsquo;s own children.&nbsp; I never found
<i>them</i> any snare to my soul, but I have found mere empty gay
professors to be a snare.&nbsp; David personated Christ when he
expressed the feelings of his soul, in the 16th Psalm, &ldquo;The
saints, the excellent of the earth, are my delight.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The Lord made David sick of every body else, yet no man was ever
so plagued with a parcel of hypocrites as he was.&nbsp; His prime
minister, Achithophel, was a snare to him.&nbsp; His chief
captain, Joab, was always a trouble, and his darling son,
Absalom, was always a most profound, ungrateful, cruel
hypocrite.&nbsp; Yet the Lord&rsquo;s people were dear to
David&rsquo;s soul, and why? because they were dear to Christ;
bore his image, trusted in him, looked for him, and walked as it
became their profession.&nbsp; And I must remind Mrs. D. that the
Apostle has pointed out a most decided evidence of a real
believer, &ldquo;We know we are passed from death to life,
because we love the brethren.&nbsp; And he that loves <i>him</i>
that begets, loves him, also, that is begotten of
<i>him</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; You could not love a believer as a child
of God; if you was not a child of God yourself.&nbsp; Sinners
love sinners, but they cannot saints, as saints.&nbsp; But while
I would have you bless God for this grace given you, and while I
would bless God on <a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
74</span>your behalf, yet, I trust, you will not rest on present
attainments, but go on to know Christ, that you may be found in
him.&nbsp; I always find it the safest way to thank God for what
he has done for me, but when I reflect upon the attainments of
hypocrites I am alarmed, and go to the Saviour, daily, just as I
did when I first set out, a poor needy, guilty sinner in myself,
condemned by law and conscience, with a nature as depraved as the
worst creature breathing, and standing in as much need of
teaching and keepings of drawing and renewing, as I ever
did.&nbsp; To this Paul alludes, nay exhorts, &ldquo;As ye have
received Christ Jesus, the Lord, so walk ye in him.&rdquo;&nbsp;
You can well remember the bondage of spirit you felt under the
Law, and how precious the person of Christ, as a complete
Saviour, was to you&mdash;how precious he appeared in his
mediatorial capacity, as an atoning sacrifice, putting away sin,
as the end of the law, fulfilling all its demands, and, as an
intercessor, pleading your cause.&nbsp; You need this same Jesus
every day, and will want him as much in the article of death, as
you did when the Lord first gave you to feel your need of
him&mdash;and I am sure you will bless the Lord for ever leading
you to feel that need so deeply.&nbsp; We are great sinners, and
need a great Saviour, every day, and all the day.&nbsp; In
reading your letter of the Lord&rsquo;s dealings with you, I
cannot help exclaiming, And will God in very deed dwell with
sinners on the earth?&nbsp; Yes, for he has said &ldquo;I will
dwell in them, and walk in them.&rdquo;&nbsp; Male and female are
all one in Christ Jesus.&nbsp; He has condescended to choose a
portion of our nature, and unite it to the dear Son of his
love&mdash;the Son of God&mdash;God the Son: and in the choice of
our nature, and the person of his Son, he chose all the millions
that shall be saved, united <a name="page75"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 75</span>them to Christ, and then viewed them
complete in him.&nbsp; Thus the head and the members rose
together in the mind, the purpose, and decree of Jehovah.&nbsp;
To these he designed to manifest himself as the God of all grace,
in the covenant of redemption and mercy&mdash;in the mysterious
incarnation of Christ&mdash;in the meritorious holiness of his
life&mdash;in the putting away sin by his awful sorrows, and in
rising from the dead to justify his own work, and as the first
fruits of them that sleep in him.&nbsp; And is it not wonderful
that God the Holy Spirit should ever visit you?&nbsp; Can you not
often ask, with your sister Ruth, &ldquo;Why have I found grace
in thy sight, that thou shouldst take knowledge of me, seeing I
am but a stranger.&rdquo;&nbsp; It becomes you to be
thankful.&nbsp; This will bring more blessings to you, in a way
of enjoyment; and as the Lord has taught you, humbled your
spirit, and melted you with his love&mdash;brought you to receive
the truth in the love of it, so I trust you will be more devoted
to him.&nbsp; He is worthy of your highest affection, your daily
addresses, and warmest gratitude.&nbsp; The Lord help you to
adorn that gospel you love, to sympathize with the afflicted in
the household of faith, to warn the unruly, and encourage the
weak ones of the flock.&nbsp; Let thy garments be always white,
and let thy head lack no ointment.&nbsp; Strive to become a
mother in Israel, by an increase of spiritual knowledge; then
your faith will grow, and your hope abound.</p>
<p>Kind respects to Mr. D.&nbsp; I am much pleased the Lord has
not forgotten him, he has seen the meaning of God&rsquo;s
promise; &ldquo;I will take you one of city, and two of a family,
and I will bring you to Zion.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the Saviour, will,
I trust, present you all faultless, before the throne of his
glory, to himself in himself in the millennium; <a
name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>and at last
he will present you to <i>his</i> Father and your Father,
<i>his</i> God and your God, when God, Father, Son, and Spirit
will be all in all.</p>
<p>Grace and peace be multiplied to you all, as a family.&nbsp;
Pray for me, that I may be kept and sanctified.</p>

<h2>LETTER XXII.</h2>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Valley of Achor</i>, <i>March</i>
1<i>st</i>, 1818.</p>
<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Harris</span>.</p>
<p><span class="GutSmall">MY DEAR YOUNG FRIEND</span>.</p>
<p>Mr. K. requested I would drop you a few lines.&nbsp; I beg
your acceptance of such as I may write at this time, in very
painful circumstances.&nbsp; Believe me, my friend, I most
sensibly feel the hand of God; my poor heart it broken, my sighs
are many, and my heart it faint.&nbsp; But I call to mind past
times, when I certainly have known, tasted, and felt the precious
truth I once preached, and then I thank God and take
courage.&nbsp; The Lord has designed from all eternity, to bring
his children home to his eternal bliss; but then he has, also,
appointed all the means to lead to that one grand end.&nbsp; This
was, perhaps, shewn to pious Jacob, in a vision of a ladder,
which he afterwards called the house of God, and the gate of
Heaven.&nbsp; Christ is all these; he is the way, he is the
house, he is the gate: and it <a name="page77"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 77</span>is the work of the Holy Spirit to
lead his people up to him, as the way of life.</p>
<p>This is the way God has taught me, and the way only where I
find any solid peace in a world of cares, sin, and death.&nbsp;
These are the seven steps up the ladder, up the way of life; and
the steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord and he shall
direct his way, and I am sure he always directs to the dear
Redeemer.&nbsp; May you feel inwardly directed to him, and in the
word, and by a faithful ministry outwardly directed also.&nbsp;
But it is not enough to be directed there, we must be led by a
divine hand, power must be put forth, for the kingdom is not in
word, but in power.&nbsp; Nor am I satisfied with any
person&rsquo;s ministry, except I feel <i>that</i>
power&mdash;any man with truth floating in his head, may send me
to Jesus; but I want the power to attend that direction, to bring
me to him, knowing, that as many as are led by the spirit of God,
they are the sons of God.&nbsp; A soul, when formed anew,
quickened and illuminated, is led to Christ by God the Father,
who owns and receives the soul.&nbsp; Nor is there any coming in
reality, but as we are led.&nbsp; You may see this in our first
parents; Eve was a part of Adam, and we are a part of Christ, the
fruit of his sufferings and death.&nbsp; For except a corn of
wheat fall into the ground, and die, it abideth alone, but if it
die, it bringeth forth fruit.&nbsp; The Lord having formed Eve,
brought her to Adam, and he declared the union between her and
him.&nbsp; He loved her, received her, and she was dear to
him.&nbsp; I leave you to make all other reflections upon this
subject, and trust the blessed spirit will lead you to see and
enjoy it in your own soul.&nbsp; I am truly happy the Lord has
impressed your mind with his spirit, while in <a
name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>youth&mdash;&rsquo;tis most blessed to know the adorable
Trinity, as our new Creators, in this time of our life.&nbsp;
Altho&rsquo; we have got to bear the burden and heat of the day
yet it is a mercy to be hired early in the morning, it is all of
grace, from first to last, nor will one chosen vessel in glory,
have any greater share of God&rsquo;s smiles, or be nearer the
throne than another, though called as early as Jeremiah and John
the Baptist, or late as the Thief on the Cross.&nbsp; You will
have much to struggle with, many days of darkness and grief, but
the blessed spirit will turn all into good for you, by taking
every opportunity of glorifying Christ, in his salvation and
offices; and the deeper your knowledge of Jesus, the richer will
be your soul in heavenly things.&nbsp; The more you are brought
into an acquaintance with the God-Man Mediator, the sweeter will
be your communion and fellowship, till it arrives to real
earnests and foretastes of glory.&nbsp; But all the principal
difficulty will consist in being led to understand how to live a
life of faith, out of self, upon the Son of God&mdash;it is for
want of the clear knowledge of this, I am in my present trouble;
this may astonish you, but God knoweth I lie not&mdash;a future
day may explain that to the Church.&nbsp; I understand the Lord
has blessed you with an affectionate heart towards your dear
Mother, and he will reward it.&nbsp; I have often envied the
felicity of those who have a kind mother to care for, watch over,
pity, and help them; but Ah! poor me was left by parents, cruel
and unkind, to perish, till I was found an helpless infant.&nbsp;
For me no tender mother has yielded her fostering care, but</p>
<blockquote><p>Left on the world&rsquo;s bleak waste, forlorn,<br
/>
In sin conceiv&rsquo;d, to sorrow born:<br />
No guide the dreary waste to tread,<br />
Above, no friendly shelter spread.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>But the
Lord had some kind, and I hope gracious design, in preserving me
till now, though my distress has often made me blame, like Job,
the kind hand that took me up when an out-cast.&nbsp; I am still
the child of woe, the hand of God and man appears against me in
providence, and my distress of mind is great&mdash;my dear
friends deprived of my public labors, and exposed to the shafts
of cruel calumny.&nbsp; My dear family without a fond mother, and
now deprived of a father they dearly loved, and whose paternal
embraces they eagerly prized: but now</p>
<blockquote><p>No Children run to lisp their Sire&rsquo;s
return,<br />
Or climb his knees, the envied kiss to share&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Excuse me, tears will not let me proceed.&nbsp; May the dear
Saviour bless you.&nbsp; We live in a dying world; a few more
rising and setting suns will settle all.&nbsp; May we aim to
know, to win, and to be found in Christ: clothed with his
righteousness, pardoned with his blood, purified by his spirit,
filled with his love, and for ever delighted with his glory.</p>

XXIII.</h2>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Valley of Achor</i>,
<i>January</i> 3<i>rd</i>, 1819.</p>
<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>,</p>
<p><span class="GutSmall">MY VERY DEAR FRIEND</span>,</p>
<p>I can never sufficiently thank you for your christian
sympathy, affectionate concern, and fervent desires for my best
interests, that you can weep with those that weep, especially for
the afflictions of Joseph.&nbsp; <i>Amos</i> 6th.&nbsp; This is a
most blessed and decided evidence that the love of God reigns in
the heart; and though this principle is often hid from its happy
possessor, perhaps it is better seen by others; but if our love
is genuine, it bears a resemblance to the love of God, to his
Son, and to his children.&nbsp; Now as dear Mrs. Brown is often
in bondage about her part and lot in Christ, and as love is the
most decided proof of that interest, let us examine this
subject.&nbsp; Hence the Saviour compares a believer who is not
clear about his interest in the favour of God, or has seen it and
lost it, to a Woman having ten pieces of silver, and having lost
one.&nbsp; Mind, it is a Woman, not a careless Man, who, if he
had lost any thing would give a general look and pass it by
rather carelessly, only perhaps saying, Well, I am very sorry I
have lost it too&mdash;and here the matter rests&mdash;but to a
Woman assiduous, careful, attentive, and vext with her
loss.&nbsp; The nine pieces of silver refer no doubt to the
graces of the Holy Spirit, but the tenth to the knowledge of the
reality and enjoyment of them.&nbsp; Time was, perhaps you could
say, you knew and believed the love that God had for you, and <a
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>no doubt but
you had love in return.&nbsp; But the scene has since changed,
and you have had to combat with enemies without, and worse
within; and on account of their prevalency, you have often been
permitted to question the reality of all you experienced before,
while busy Satan has suggested, Where is your religion now?&nbsp;
Where is your love to Christ?&nbsp; Are you a Christian?&nbsp; Up
starts Unbelief, and says, I will never believe a person can be a
partaker of Christ, be in Christ, love Christ, or ever be one of
Christ&rsquo;s, that can think as you think, say as you say, or
do as you do.&nbsp; No, no, says carnal Reason, why it stands to
common sense, that a converted person is a changed one
altogether.&nbsp; Now Mrs. B. looks within, thinks deep of it,
while the dust these things have raised, blinds her eyes, that
she sees not her spiritual signs, but listens to those
suggestions, and rashly concludes against herself, that, perhaps,
all her past experience was but fancy.&nbsp; Under these fears we
live too long.&nbsp; <i>Ephraim</i>, says God, is an unwise Son,
for he should not stay long in the place of the breaking forth of
children.&nbsp; But perhaps some sweet idea occurs about Christ
and his love, his work and his word; or some very precious
sermon, chapter, or hymn.&nbsp; This comes and revives the old
work; Satan withdraws, hope springs up, and a thirst for God is
felt again.&nbsp; Now we begin to stir, to light a candle, to
sweep the house, and to search diligently for the sense of
God&rsquo;s love, favor, and pardoning mercy.&nbsp; Sweeping is
self-examination, comparing spiritual things with
spiritual&mdash;that is, our judgement, experience, and views,
with God&rsquo;s word.&nbsp; Lighting a candle is going to
Christ, as the true light, enabling you to see his glory, his
beauty, his goodness.&nbsp; And this glory, goodness, and beauty
is called his <a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>loving kindness, &ldquo;We have thought of thy loving
kindness in thy temple.&rdquo;&nbsp; And this is what David
prayed for, I have desired of the Lord, that I may see the beauty
of the Lord.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thine eyes shall see the king in his
beauty.&rdquo;&nbsp; And surely the Lord never appears so
beautiful to us, as when he appears, a God, pardoning our
sins.&nbsp; Well may we exclaim, And let the beauty of the Lord
our God be upon us; I know you can say Amen to this.&nbsp; Moses
desired to see the glory of God, and the Lord promised to cause
his goodness to pass before him, and proclaimed, forgiving
iniquity, transgression, and sin.&nbsp; Thus all his excellencies
are seen in this great act; and sure I am, that a sweet clear
sight of this blessing, is more worth than a thousand
worlds.&nbsp; This will cause us to shout victory in death and
judgement.&nbsp; O may you not only hope, but see this blessing;
and not only see it, but enjoy it, for it is the joint work of
the adorable Trinity.&nbsp; The Father foresaw all our guilt, and
secretly purposed to pardon it.&nbsp; The dear Redeemer foresaw
all that our sins would merit, and engaged to bear it.&nbsp; And
the divine, the blessed Spirit, foresaw all our backslidings, yet
engaged to enable us to believe&mdash;we are pardoned and
justified in the name and by the Spirit of our God.</p>
<p>I wish you much of this blessing, in believing views of
Christ.&nbsp; The Lord has enlightened you to see Jesus as
altogether lovely; your will has chosen him, your heart is at
rest when he is truly precious, and you can say, he is supreme in
your affections.&nbsp; Bless his dear name for it; his love is
set upon you, and Satan knows it, if you don&rsquo;t, and he will
follow up the Lord&rsquo;s work diligently, either to destroy it,
or to set <a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
83</span>you doubting its reality.&nbsp; But the principal part
is love, and all our love to Jesus is but a reflection of his
love to us.&nbsp; He says, Yea, I have loved thee; and we can
reply, And Lord I desire to love thee most supremely.&nbsp; God
loves his dear Son, and so do we; he loves his truth, so do we;
he loves his saints, and so do we.&nbsp; He hates their sins, so
do we; he pities their infirmities, so do we; he forgives their
follies, so do we; he feels for them in trouble, so do we; he
visits them in prison of soul, or circumstances, so do we; he
loves their company, prayers, praises, converse, and prosperity
of soul, so do we; he hates their enemies, with all their cruelty
and malice, so do we; he will one day punish their enemies,
unless grace prevent it, and we shall say Amen to it.</p>
<p>Thus, in a very simple manner, have I shewed the reality of
Bible love.&nbsp; But I want to live such a life of faith on
Jesus, as Paul did, when he said, The life I live in the flesh, I
live by the faith of the Son of God, as Jesus did, as man, on his
divine Father.&nbsp; So we should live on Jesus, as God-Man
Mediator, on his eternal unchanging love; his covenant
engagements; his meritorious work of obedience; his putting away
sin, by his sufferings and death; his intercession at the
Father&rsquo;s right hand, and his glorious office, as an
advocate for us, ever pleading his blood, with which God is well
pleased.&nbsp; On him may we live, to him may we go, <i>and him
in every thing employ</i>.&nbsp; We are sinners, and need his
grace, guilty, and need his blood, condemned, and need his
righteousness, weak, and need his arm, miserable, and need his
mercy, rebellious, and need his long suffering.&nbsp; Thus we are
poor and needy, and every promise in the Bible made to such, is
<a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
84</span>your&rsquo;s.&nbsp; O that we could so resist Satan,
when he comes to dispute us out of these things, that we might
take courage and read them all as our own.&nbsp; Then we shall be
rich indeed, for God is faithful to his Son, in whom they are
made; and to his people, to whom they are revealed.</p>

1st, 1819.</p>
<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Miller</span>,</p>
<p><span class="GutSmall">MY DEAR FRIEND</span>,</p>
<p>This day of the month never comes, but it ever brings a
variety of very affecting ideas to my mind, as it is supposed to
be the day on which I was found, when an helpless infant,
deserted by parents, and left to perish; but the Lord had some
gracious intention in preserving me, till called and brought
forth to public view.&nbsp; Blessed by many, and by many
cursed.&nbsp; Yet the curse, causeless, has not, nor shall ever
come.&nbsp; We have had the pleasure of dining together for some
years, as on this day, and I trust we shall spend a blessed
eternity together, when time, with us, shall be no more.&nbsp; It
is my mercy that, though I was left fatherless, and motherless, I
am not left Christless.&nbsp; But when father and mother forsook
me, the Lord took me up, and dealt better for me than my poor
parents could <a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span>have done, perhaps, even in providence.&nbsp; On this
subject I need not enlarge, as I hope, while I am in Babylon, to
write my own memoirs, and publish it when I have an
opportunity.&nbsp; But this depends on the display of the
gracious office of God, the Holy Spirit, to act as my
remembrancer.&nbsp; I am sorry I have been so negligent of the
gracious dealings of God with me, in providence and grace; and
have not set up those way marks, which I ought to have noticed,
and which, no doubt, would be a satisfaction to my own friends,
the comfort of my own mind, and for the glory of God.&nbsp; But,
my dear friend, while my tongue is partially silent many dear
spiritual people want a small token of my spiritual regard for
them, by recommending the dear and adorable Saviour to
them.&nbsp; As the pen of cruel slander, and daring calumny, has
been so much employed against me, I want to employ my pen in
writing of him, whom angels admire and saints adore; and whose
dear name, I trust, you love, whose gospel you prize, and whose
saints you esteem; and as a proof you love him, only reflect, in
some silent secret moment, suppose he was to frown upon you in
death, and disown you in the last great day.&nbsp; What an
horror, grief, and misery do you feel in the thought!&nbsp; What,
to be for ever banished from God!&mdash;from Jesus!&nbsp; O sad
and dreadful idea; if the thought indulged is Hell enough to you,
&rsquo;tis a proof you love him.&nbsp; And do you not feel, at
times, a secret satisfaction, a sacred pleasure, when you hear or
receive any new sweet thought of Jesus?&mdash;&rsquo;tis because
you love him.&nbsp; And should you not like to be favored with
much communion with him, to open your whole heart to him, and
find his whole heart open to you?&mdash;&rsquo;tis because you
love him.&nbsp; And if you hear a thing called a preacher, and he
appear <a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
86</span>empty of Jesus, do you not feel disgusted at
him?&mdash;&rsquo;tis because you love him.&nbsp; When you hear
his sacred name blasphemed, or in any sense slighted, do you not
feel hurt at it, and pray that you may never be sent to Hell,
among Devils, who will be for ever cursing it; but long to get to
glory, where you will join with angels in always praising
it?&mdash;&rsquo;tis because you love him.&nbsp; If a person
stands very high in your estimation, whom you believe to be well
taught of Jesus, do you not feel an on common respect for
him?&mdash;&rsquo;tis because you love him.&nbsp; If you are very
cold, dead, dark, and barren in soul, in secret and public, and
feel as if you could not honor Jesus by bringing forth fruit to
his praise, is not this matter of much grief to
you?&mdash;&rsquo;tis because you love him.&nbsp; When you feel
for his people, his despised ministers and cause, that is
unjustly hated, and cruelly treated, &rsquo;tis because you love
him.&nbsp; Do you not feel glad when you hear of the sound
conversion of any one to Jesus, when they are able to give a
scriptural account of the Lord&rsquo;s dealings with
them?&mdash;&rsquo;tis because you love him.&nbsp; Do you not
feel grateful to the Saviour, when you are favored with an
affecting sight of him, as dying for you, rising for you, and
living for you?&mdash;&rsquo;tis because you love him.&nbsp; Do
you not feel thankful at times, that the good work was ever begun
in your heart, and that you have any love to him&mdash;surely
&rsquo;tis because you love him.&nbsp; When you reflect upon his
kindness to you in providence, with a keen sense of your utter
unkindness, do you feel, or desire to feel
grateful?&mdash;&rsquo;tis because you love him.&nbsp; Do you
desire, above all things else beside, to live to him, feel peace
with him, and at last, to be with him for ever; to adore and
thank him; to crown him Lord of all, with all the blood-bought
throng?&mdash;&rsquo;tis because you <a name="page87"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 87</span>love him.&nbsp; And we love him,
because he first loved us&mdash;</p>

<h2>LETTER XXV.</h2>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Valley of Achor</i>, <i>Jan.</i>

<p>Mr. J. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>.</p>
<p><span class="GutSmall">MY VERY DEAR FRIEND</span>,</p>
<p>I thank you for your letter.&nbsp; I am always glad to hear
how my dear friends go on in the divine life; and if they are not
increasing sensibly in faith, hope, and love, yet, if growing
downward in humility it is still well.&nbsp; What we are in our
fallen state, as sinners, must be learned by us&mdash;this is all
the hell we shall ever experience in this world, and some have
found <i>that</i> to be quite hell enough.&nbsp; Under this
painful chastening, Jonah cried out of the belly of
hell.&mdash;The Psalmist declared God had laid him in the lowest
deeps.&nbsp; Jeremiah wished he had never been born&mdash;and Job
cursed his day!&mdash;and all their painful agonies of soul was
nothing to be compared to the painful soul-distress which the
Lord Jesus felt, when he entered the garden of Gethsemane, and
his vast mind was filled with horrors, terrors, and
frights&mdash;the guilt of sin sunk his spirits, the wrath of God
melted his heart&mdash;and his agonies were
inconceivable.&mdash;Oh! <a name="page88"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 88</span>what did our Christ endure for some
hours, yea, from nine o&rsquo;clock at night till three the next
afternoon: it will never be forgotten by him&mdash;his whole mind
was taken up with it; every thing else was forgotten.&mdash;Sin
and wrath, guilt and distress followed on him&mdash;wave upon
wave, till he expired.&nbsp; And the very posture in which he
hung as he died was very important.&nbsp; See his dear arms
stretched out to receive you and me.&nbsp; See his dear feet
waiting, fastened to the cross, to confer his blessing.&nbsp; See
his side wide opened, to shew his heart to us&mdash;and see him
bow his dear dying head, to kiss the poor returning soul, who is
waiting at the foot of the cross till Jesus assures the soul of
its interest in him.&nbsp; Here, I hope, my much esteemed friend
is waiting.&nbsp; Here he is safe.</p>
<p>But you complain of sin&mdash;the Old man.&nbsp; And what is
this old man?&mdash;it is <i>a continual inclination to
sin</i>.&nbsp; Can the brightest saint alter this?&mdash;alas,
No: And are you not astonished that such poor sinful beings as we
are, that we should ever be proud of our rags?&nbsp; Proud, in
the sight of God!&mdash;such is our depravity.&nbsp; And it is
from this same source you feel so much deadness in divine things,
so much darkness in soul, and such carelessness and wanderings in
your best moments; these all spring from the heart, which we find
to be bad indeed.&nbsp; I once knew a little of it, and often
preached about it, but my views of it are much deeper now&mdash;I
both see and feel, groan under and hate, what I cannot get rid
of.&nbsp; O could I but get rid of what I feel, how happy should
I be.&nbsp; There is but one remedy left, and that is a more
blessed acquaintance with the dear Saviour, and the enjoyment of
high and heavenly communion with him.&nbsp; To this <a
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>blessing I
humbly aspire.&nbsp; This fevor I am praying daily
for&mdash;<i>this</i>, and <i>this</i> only, is the cure of all
our spiritual diseases.&nbsp; This will make me happy in
captivity, and contented with the will of God.&nbsp; But, alas, I
am very rebellious!&nbsp; What a mercy when we can see that every
trial, cross, loss, disappointment, pain, and difficulty is in
covenant love, flowing to us, because God has loved us; and to
conform us to his lovely image, we want the mind kept by an
almighty power&mdash;still, resigned, quiet, and composed, as a
hand ought to be steady, that holds a glass of some very costly
liquid.&nbsp; We want keeping quiet, while God takes the
opportunity of pouring into the soul the precious consolations;
and helps us to believe that whatever happens, is certainly
right, and will be for the best.&nbsp; I have heard of a man,
that whatever he met with, he said it was for the best.&nbsp; One
day, a dog stole his dinner, and his ungodly companions asked
him, if that was for the best?&nbsp; They all being at work in
the quarry, the man said, he would just run and see if the dog
had eat all his dinner; and while he was gone out, the pit fell
in, and killed all his companions.&nbsp; Thus it was for the best
that the dog should steal his dinner.</p>
<p>I find there is nothing like prayer, reflection, and
gratitude; but I am exactly like yourself; I am distressed with
those opposite sinful propensities, which it is impossible to
avoid; these intercept my peace, perplex my soul, grieve my
spirit, becloud my evidences, and often steal my heart from God,
till the Saviour shines again, and then I am renewed, refreshed,
and strengthened again.&nbsp; May your spirit often thus
experience the very gracious operations of the Holy Spirit,
causing you to know, trust, and love the person of Jesus, <a
name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>as your
covenant head, alone Saviour, all-sufficient righteousness and
atoning sacrifice, ever-living intercessor and wonderful
counsellor.&nbsp; May he be more precious to your heart, and
dearer to your soul, in life and death; and may the same grace
rest on your dear partner in life, and family, is the earnest
prayer, and hearty wish, of your ever sincere and grateful</p>

<p><span class="GutSmall">MY DEAR TRIED FRIEND</span>,</p>
<p>The Lord accepts the will for the deed, from his dear
people.&nbsp; You: would do me much good, if it lay in your
power; but the Lord has enabled you to say, To will, is present
with me; and the Apostle says, If there was a willing mind, it is
accepted.&nbsp; David wanted to build an house for the Lord, but
he had not liberty; yet the dear Saviour sent him word, it was
well it was in his heart.&nbsp; The will was
accepted.&mdash;Pious Mary had once anointed her Saviour, and she
intended to do it again at his burial; but fearing she might not
have the honor to embalm him, she came before hand, and anointed
him to his burial.&nbsp; The Saviour accepted the will for the
deed, and declared, wherever the Gospel was preached, this kind
act should be noticed.&nbsp; So we find in our experience.&nbsp;
We would love God&mdash;without a rival.&nbsp; We would know him
as <a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>he is
in Christ; perfectly; we would enjoy him uninterruptedly; we
would hold perpetual communion with him; we would serve him, day
and night; we would never dishonour him, grieve him, offend him,
or slight him; we would never sin against him any more.&nbsp; But
O, we cannot attain to this; how to perform <i>that</i> which is
good, we find we cannot.&nbsp; So we would comfort the saints,
relieve the afflicted, cheer the disconsolate, plead for the
truth, and support the cause of God.&nbsp; Bring into the way of
truth all our dear friends; and if it was agreeable to the
decrees of God, we would bring in all to the knowledge of the
truth&mdash;however dark you may feel, however miserable you may
seem, I hope the Lord will over-rule that, to bring you out of
yourself, daily to die to self, daily to be looking to Jesus, and
being satisfied that he is your eternal all, that he has taken
away all your guilt, that he has bore all your sins, that he has
obeyed for you, that he is your intercessor before the throne,
that he lives to plead your cause, manage all your concerns, turn
every apparent evil into good, will never leave you until he has
done all the good he his promised unto you.</p>
<p>I am a little acquainted with your trials; much as I am tried
myself, I would not exchange troubles with you.&nbsp; I thank you
for your kind wish, that I may be favored with the divine
presence, this is the general prayer of the Lord&rsquo;s people,
for me, and I am much honored with it.&nbsp; What shall I render
to the Lord.&nbsp; I hope he is leading me to the knowledge of
Christ, it is eternal life to know him; and God has promised us
an heart to know him, so as to live upon him, make use of him,
and give him all the glory.&nbsp; As this is so capital a
blessing, so I must remind you that <a name="page92"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 92</span>this is the work of the Holy Ghost,
in the heart; and his sacred indwelling, is the presence of
God.&nbsp; Let thy Presence go with me, prayed Moses.&nbsp; This
was typified by the Cloudy Pillar, which abode upon, encompassed
round, and led, protected, and cheered the Israelites, for forty
years; and although they often rebelled, fretted, complained, and
sinned against God, yet he bore with their manners, changed his
conduct, tried them, and permitted them to be beset by enemies,
yet he did not take away the cloudy pillar.&nbsp; You know how to
apply this subject.&nbsp; I bless God the work is going on in
your soul, and if the following things I see in you, and gather
from your kind letter, are evidences of the work of God, my dear
friend is in possession of it.&nbsp; A being quickened to see the
misery of a fallen nature.&nbsp; Humbling views of your own
nothingness.&nbsp; An earnest desire for communion with Christ,
in his own ordinances.&nbsp; A patient, yet longing, waiting for
pardoning love to be manifested to the soul, with power.&nbsp; A
daily cross, felt from nature, sin, Satan, and the world.&nbsp; A
grief of heart, that you cannot serve the Lord as you
desire.&nbsp; Sympathy with the tried people of God.&nbsp;
Gratitude for past experiences, of the power of God on the
soul.&nbsp; A coming out of self daily, and leaning upon Jesus,

<p><span class="GutSmall">MY DEAR FRIENDS</span>,</p>
<p>I trust the God of all grace is carrying on his own work in
both your souls.&nbsp; This may be doubted by you in your darkest
seasons, but when you feel the word with power, when you get
access to God, when you feel joy and peace in believing, when you
feel Christ very precious to your soul, <i>then</i> you are at a
point about it.&nbsp; None can persuade you out of your feelings,
nor dispute you out of your esteem for, and love to Christ, his
truths, his people, or his word.&nbsp; Your spiritual birth is
clear, your title to heaven is plain, you have then a sensible
witness in yourself, that you are born of God, and that you know
God.&nbsp; You have had such seasons: this is tasting the new
wine of the kingdom, this is finding the Pearl of great Price,
this is the new heart of flesh, this is the right spirit, this is
coming into the banqueting house, this is being fed with honey
out of the rock, this is enjoying the fatted calf; the ring of
eternal love, the wedding garment, and the shoes of the gospel of
peace.&nbsp; This is finding the piece of silver, and proving
wisdom&rsquo;s ways pleasantness, and her paths peace.&nbsp; This
is walking in the light of God&rsquo;s countenance, and receiving
the end of our faith&mdash;the present salvation of the
soul.&nbsp; I have had a few such times as these since I have
been here, but these have <a name="page94"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 94</span>not lasted long; I wish they had so
overpowered me, that they had broke up old nature, and ushered me
into the full enjoyment of God.&nbsp; But the sun is gone down,
night is come on again, the beasts of the forest creep forth, the
Devil takes every advantage, and the world seems to frown, yet
every thing urges the necessity of walking by faith, of making
use of Christ as the Almighty physician, the healer of breaches,
and the restorer of wanderers.&nbsp; This is the name that is
very precious to us, I am the Lord that healeth thee; and every
gracious look from him, melts us, renews us, revives us, and
conquers the heart.&nbsp; This was the look that melted
Peter.&nbsp; A great traveller and writer says he saw some rocks
abroad, which dropped water when the sun shone on them.&nbsp;
This was true, indeed, of Peter, whose name signifies a rock, or
a stone; and it is equally true of us, who are called
stones.&nbsp; I ever wish to be under the soul melting influence
of the Holy Spirit.&nbsp; Oh, that he would so blessedly overcome
our hearts with his love, in great power.&nbsp; This is what I am
praying to feel very often, yet, it is the will of our divine
Lord, to exercise our minds sharply with sore trials; and, the
very worst of all trials, is a being daily burdened with sin,
working within, and, like prisoners, either entreating for
liberty, or trying to get out.&nbsp; These often hide the Saviour
from us, and make it winter in the soul; faith is weak, hope is
low, love is cold, and patience is gone sick to bed; yet the Lord
is at hand, he is very near, although we see him not, nor feel
him.&nbsp; Jacob said, The Lord is in this place, and I knew it
not.&nbsp; Philosophers say, The sun is nearer to us in winter
than in summer; this does not appear true, but it has been, and
is very easily proved.&nbsp; So Christ, the Son of righteousness,
is nearer to us in <a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
95</span>our winter graces of faith and patience, than in our
summer graces of joy, hope, peace, and love.&nbsp; He makes his
way to us, when we cannot find the way to him, he seeks us, when
we cannot seek him, he can find us, and he holds us, when we
cannot find him, or claim him as our&rsquo;s.&nbsp; That precious
text, 13th Zechariah, and last verse, is often precious to me in
this furnace; the God of truth promises, first, I will bring you
through; second, They shall call on my name; third, I will try
them; fourth, I will say they are mine; fifth, and they shall say
the Lord is mine.&nbsp; What a feast does this text afford me in
those days of my calamity; some parts have been fulfilled in my
experience, the other part will ere long: and as soon as the
deliverance comes, we must look out for some other trials.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Christian&rsquo;s seldom long at ease,<br />
One Trial gone, another doth him seize.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the way; but as loved, redeemed, called, pardoned by
precious blood, and justified by imputed righteousness, we shall
get safe home, to celebrate eternal mercy, as displayed by a
triune God in our salvation.&nbsp; I long for the time to meet
you both again, at the table of the Lord.&nbsp; I trust Christ
will be more dear to us than ever, that we shall be dying daily,
and living in, and by, and with Christ.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Farmer</span>.</p>
<p><span class="GutSmall">MY MUCH ESTEEMED FRIEND</span>,</p>
<p>You must think me very unkind, and seemingly negligent in
writing to you, but I can assure you I have never forgotten you,
from the first day of our acquaintance.&nbsp; I often anticipate
the period when, I hope, we shall often yet meet on praying
ground&mdash;in the church militant, and finally, in the church
triumphant.&nbsp; At present the church is in a militant state;
the term is military, and implies a warfare, contending powers,
within and without.&nbsp; The worst lays within&mdash;every evil
done in this world, and every sin in devils; we have the root of
them in our hearts; this we must feel, groan under, and lament;
we derived this nature from our first parent, his sin became
our&rsquo;s, as we stood in him, we sinned in him, and fell with
him, we are guilty of his sin, and it is imputed to us.&nbsp; So
we also took a most corrupt nature, and this is seen as soon as
we can shew it.&nbsp; We go astray from the womb, and should
stray into hell, if it was not for the grace of God; and being
depraved, how could we do any thing that is good.&nbsp; Alas! if
our salvation depended on a good thought, we must have been lost
for ever.&nbsp; Almighty mercy has shewn you those things; and
when you hear any talk, or see them hoping upon their own
goodness, does it not raise disgust in your mind at the
sentiment.&nbsp; Bless God for causing <a name="page97"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 97</span>you to differ; you might have been
left to the blindness of your mind, the perversity of your will,
and the hatred of the heart to God!&nbsp; You find these things
still working, but they do not reign.&nbsp; They, and every other
evil in the heart, are like rebellious prisoners, are often
contriving schemes to get out, and to regain the old liberty you
used to give them; but although they rebel, and may prevail
against you, yet, they never can take the castle of the
heart.&nbsp; There may be a bias, a propensity to evil, but you
can never be a carnal man again&mdash;you may look like one, feel
like one, and suffer like one; but though this may grieve you, it
shall never be accomplished in the way Satan desires.&nbsp; Hence
Solomon says, There is vanity I have seen on the earth; that
there be just men, to whom it happeneth according to the work of
the wicked, and that there be wicked men, to whom it happeneth
according to the work of the righteous.&nbsp; I said, This also
is vanity.&nbsp; I trust your convictions are genuine, and this
is the first work of the Spirit, to prepare the way for the
revelation of Christ to the soul.&nbsp; Christ has no room in an
unhumbled, hard, careless, unconvinced, unbroken spirit.&nbsp; He
has declared he will dwell with none but those who contrite and
humbled&mdash;These characters are particularly described in his
commission, as set forth in Isaiah xli, 1, 2, 3.&nbsp; This was
the first text our dear Lord took when he preached in the
Synagogue; and although we have no account of the sermon, yet the
substance of it was given by our Lord to his disciples, on the
Mount, in the 5th of Matthew, where we have an eight-fold
description of the persons interested in him, as the eternal life
of his saints.&nbsp; God&rsquo;s blessing on mount Zion, is life
for evermore; and when the Priest, under the old Law, declared
the blessing to the <a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span>people, he always said, The Lord bless thee; so Christ,
our great High Priest, began his sermon with blessing&mdash;it
was no part of his work to pronounce the curse of the Law.&nbsp;
Hence he said to the Jews, Think not that I will accuse you to
the Father, there is one that accuseth you already, Moses, in
whom you trust.&nbsp; There is nothing in the heart of Christ to
his people, but love, mercy, pity, goodwill, and kindness; he
knows all our sins and God-provoking crimes, in thought, word,
and deed, but these he does not so much as mention, only by
pleading his precious blood for their forgiveness, and by setting
his work against our sins.&nbsp; Hence these two precious texts,
&ldquo;I, even I, am he that blotteth I out thy
transgressions.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The blood of Jesus Christ,
his Son, cleanseth us from all sin.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is in the
present tense, it is above, yea, infinitely above all our
sins.&nbsp; The precious work of Christ is compared to a sea, for
its abundance; and our guilt is compared to a mountain, which may
be cast into the sea, but it would be soon lost there.&nbsp; This
arises from the dignity of the person who died for us, it was
Jehovah Jesus&mdash;possessing every divine perfection in his
nature, God over all blessed for ever, who condescended to take
up our nature, and obey the law, as man&mdash;which himself has
given, as God.&nbsp; This was surprising love indeed, love to his
own law, and love to us, as sinners.&nbsp; May we love him with
every power and passion on earth and in heaven.&nbsp; Christ
God-Man is our Saviour&mdash;he is the Head of the Church, as the
elect, and the only Saviour of her, as fallen.&nbsp; He is
Prophet, Priest, and King to us; and these grand offices he has
gloriously delayed in obtaining our salvation, and by the holy
influences of the Spirit making them known to us.&nbsp; As blind
and ignorant, we need God-Man for our Instructor.&nbsp; As <a
name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>rebels
against God, and slaves to Satan, we need him for our King, to
subdue and conquer us.&nbsp; As bound over to judgment, and
exposed to misery, we need him as our Priest, to intercede for
us.&nbsp; And this will give you sweet light into that glorious,
but well known text, 9th Isaiah, &ldquo;Unto us a child is born,
unto us a son is given; and his name shall be called Wonderful,
Counsellor, the mighty God, the everlasting Father, the Prince of
Peace.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here is the whole of Christ made manifest, in
his two natures, divine and human.&nbsp; Here are his blessed
offices, Counsellor in his prophetic office, the everlasting
Father, in his priestly office, the mighty God and Prince of
Peace, in his kingly office.&nbsp; May this subject be precious
to your soul, and may God the holy Ghost give you supernatural
ideas of Christ, and of the Father&rsquo;s love to him, and in
him.&nbsp; Most hearers are satisfied with their own natural
knowledge of Christ; may you and I be blest with supernatural
views&mdash;if the Lord favours me with much of this blessing, I
shall not murmur at two years captivity.&nbsp; The liberty of the
soul is of the greatest importance; and very often those who have
the greatest bondage of body and circumstances, are favored with
the sweetest access to God.&nbsp; When the streams of creature
comfort run dry, the fountain is most divinely prized.&nbsp; Seek
his favour, and labour in spirit for the fullest assurance of
faith, hope, and spiritual understanding.</p>
<p>My kindest love to your better half, and her dear
mother.&nbsp; Something strikes my mind I shall meet you all
three in heaven.&nbsp; I know not what will befal me in future;
the Lord is able to make it light at midnight, and I think I know
what it means&mdash;&rsquo;tis darkness all round me, strange it
should be light within, yet so I <a name="page100"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 100</span>sometimes find it.&nbsp; The
Egyptian enemies are in total darkness, but the spiritual
Israelites have light in their dwellings.&nbsp; I cannot send
your dear wife and mother but these three verses.</p>
<blockquote><p>Great God I would not ask to see,<br />
What in futurity shall be;<br />
If light and bliss attend my days,<br />
Then let my future hours be praise.</p>
<p>Is darkness and distress my share,<br />
Then let me trust thy guardian care.<br />
Enough for me, if love divine,<br />
At length through every cloud shall shine.</p>
<p>Yet <i>this</i> my soul desires to know,<br />
Be <i>this</i> my only wish below,<br />
That Christ is <i>mine</i>&mdash;this great request<br />
Grant blessed Lord, and I am blest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My heart is so sweetly opened in writing to you all, that you
must pardon every error.&nbsp; I hope you do me the favor of
taking in my scrawl every fort&rsquo;night.&nbsp; Give my kind
love to dear Mrs. Wise, and to Mrs. Barns&mdash;God bless you

1<i>st</i>, 1819.</p>
<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Wise</span>.</p>
<p><span class="GutSmall">MY DEAR FRIEND</span>,</p>
<p>I have had such repeated proofs of your kindness and concern,
that I may well address you thus, I cannot sufficiently express
my obligations&mdash;this is a subject I know is not very
pleasant to you, but gratitude compels me to make this
acknowledgment.&nbsp; I beg the Lord to bless you with much
grace, in the knowledge of himself; this will be making you
really wise indeed, you will then become wise in spirit, as well
as name.&nbsp; God has promised that all his people shall know
him, from the least to the greatest, this is the joint work of
the adorable Trinity.&nbsp; The Father teaches us out of his
love, and after chastening us with a sense of his displeasure
with our sins, he clothes us with the righteousness of Christ,
and draws our hearts to Christ.&nbsp; The dear Saviour accepts
us, and shews us the love of the Father to us, opens his own
work, instructs us in the knowledge of his person, nature,
engagements and offices; while the ever blessed Spirit displays
his kind offices, by bearing testimony of Christ in his exact
suitableness to us.&nbsp; He reveals the dignity, excellency, and
value of Christ; he bears witness to our spirits that we are the
children of God.&nbsp; This he does in his ordinary operations,
by enabling us to see, that our experience and views, are
agreeable to his promises; that his leadings and teachings, are
the very footsteps of the flock; that his word and our experience
corresponds.&nbsp; Thus the ever adorable Spirit, as a witness,
<a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>enables
us to compare spiritual things with spiritual, spiritual
experience with spiritual truths in the word.&nbsp; In this
gracious influence, you would do well to examine the word.&nbsp;
Look, for instance, into many precious Psalms, see how they suit
you; then read many grand parts of Isaiah, particularly the 54th
chapter; then the latter part of Ezekiel, 36th chapter; the 3rd
of John, 10th of Romans, and indeed wherever the work of the
Spirit is set forth&mdash;because the work of the Holy Spirit in
the heart, is the sure evidence of an interest in the love of
God, and in the person, love, and grace of Christ.&nbsp; This is
an infallible testimony; but sometimes the Lord more sensibly
overcomes the soul with his love, and extends peace like a river;
then our comforts abound, our joys are real, and we feel that we
are at peace with God.&nbsp; We get then indeed upon the mount of
high communion and fellowship, we feel his love, we feel the
comforts of the Gospel, we feel the joys of his salvation.&nbsp;
Now, in both these instances the Spirit bears witness; the first
is common, the latter special.&nbsp; I prize the first because it
abides, the last, only is enjoyed but seldom&mdash;I could wish
it always did, but where would be the warfare, where would be the
carrying a daily cross.&nbsp; I have experienced both in this
place, more divinely than even I did before; and I am brought to
hate sin more than ever, for these three reasons especially;
because it is high rebellion against the best of Fathers; because
it murdered the Son of God; and because it is so offensive to the
Holy Spirit.&nbsp; These are the reasons; and you know it is one
thing to hate sin, because of the injuries it does us, and
another thing to hate it, because it offends the Lord.&nbsp; May
you feel the consolations of the Holy Spirit often in your soul,
and when you do not, still, I <a name="page103"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 103</span>trust, you will be led to the
Father&rsquo;s record of Christ, and the ever blessed
Spirit&rsquo;s testimony of him; and as your faith increases, so
you will find it most blessed to live in believing views of him,
as the everlasting covenant Head of his people, as putting away
sin, as making intercession for you, and daily presenting your
person to God; and as your righteousness, strength, your joy, and
your all.&nbsp; And if you live a thousand years in the church
militant, you will never out-live this humble doting of
faith&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>A guilty, weak, and helpless worm,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On thy kind arms I fall;<br />
Be thou my strength and righteousness,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My Jesus, and my all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>True wisdom consists in fearing the Lord.&nbsp; Behold, the
fear of the Lord, that is wisdom.&nbsp; It also consists in
flying to Christ for refuge&mdash;The prudent man foreseeth the
evil, and hideth himself.&nbsp; It consists in the knowing our
sins are forgiven us&mdash;The Day Spring from on high hath
visited us, to give the knowledge of salvation, by the
forgiveness of sin.&mdash;It also consists in the blessed
operations of the Holy Spirit&mdash;The wisdom which is from
above is pure, peaceable, and heavenly.&nbsp; And true wisdom
also consists in a good knowledge of the word of God.&nbsp; This
is able in the power of God, to make us wise to
salvation.&mdash;May this be your happy experience, and you will
be wise indeed.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>.</p>
<p><span class="GutSmall">MY DEAR OLD FRIEND</span>,</p>
<p>I trust these lines will find you well in health, seeking the
Lord from a feeling sense of need, waiting for more grace, that
you may love the Saviour more, and serve him better.&nbsp; He is
a good master, and I have found him so.&nbsp; He is kind, loving,
and gracious, and no doubt I shall prove him so to the end.&nbsp;
I find him now in his supporting hand, his sacred presence, his
word sweet in reading, and his throne still open to receive my
petitions.&nbsp; I am shut out from my public work, but I am not
shut out from God, and I shall yet see why I am put in this
place, through the cruelty of a wicked man, who has sworn
falsely, both before a magistrate and a judge, when I could not
defend myself, but he will have his reward another day.&nbsp; No
doubt I am sent here for some very great end, and if it is but
for the good of one soul, it will be worth all my sorrow.&nbsp; I
only want to live to know more of Christ, to bring forth more
fruit to God, and to be useful to others&mdash;and I may be
useful here, as well as in any other place.&nbsp; I hope you will
be favored by the blessed Spirit with an enlarged mind, to see
such excellencies in Christ&mdash;as God-Man Mediator, as bearing
all your sin, as suffering in your stead, as obeying the law for
you, taking away the sting of death, rising for your life,
ascending to heaven, and appearing in your room <a
name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>for you
before God; in a prepared place to make intercession with God, to
send you every blessing, and to wait till your appointed time,
then he will send for you home, to be with him for ever.&nbsp;
There you will see his face, and never, never sin.&nbsp; These
are blessings you must long for, if you belong to God.&nbsp; Sin
must be felt as a burden, sin must be hated as an enemy, sin must
be fled from as a serpent, sin must be pardoned and took away
before God; and nothing can do this for us, but the precious
blood of Christ, and the free favour of God, manifested in the
work of the Holy Spirit, leading our minds to the Saviour, and
enabling us to believe in him to the saving of the soul.&nbsp; O
that you may be blessed with clearer knowledge, stronger faith,
greater love, and sweeter obedience.&nbsp; I am grieved I am not
able to preach the unsearchable riches of Christ, as I once did,
but I live in the hopes of being a greater blessing to the church
than I ever was before; but, I trust, if I ever do again, I shall
keep many at a greater distance than I did before.&nbsp; I am at
times broken-hearted about the cause of Christ, especially that
part of it I had the management of.&nbsp; It is like a ship at
sea, we will call her the Packet Distress&mdash;the disciples
went out to sea, night came on, the wind blew hard, the sea arose
in consequence of it, the poor ship was in the dark, and in the
deep.&nbsp; No sails were unfurled, they were obliged to tug at
the oar, and after they had rowed a great way, Jesus was seen on
the water coming towards them; but although when they were
toiling in rowing, and what is very blessed to remember is, that
while they were tossed about on the stormy sea, Jesus was on a
mountain, praying for them.&nbsp; This circumstance was in the
6th chapter of Mark, 45 to 51st verse; the 6th of John, 16 to
21st verse.&nbsp; I need not <a name="page106"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 106</span>tell you a great storm has arose, by
reason of a great wind that has blown&mdash;blessed be God it is
but wind, and the Lord commands that, and he must allay it, when
he has accomplished all the ends he had in view.&nbsp; And though
he permits these things, he has some grand end in view&mdash;he
will be glorified in all he permits.&nbsp; The sailors had no
sails up in this storm, it was too great, and perhaps very little
love is felt by those who are tempest tossed, so that we must ply
the oar of all-prayer together, and in due time the dear Redeemer
will appeal to our joy.&nbsp; He is now in heaven, I hope
pleading the cause of his poor tried people, and in life own
time, when we are tired in toiling and rowing, we shall see him
treading down the proud waves of our enemies, and calling
out&mdash;<i>It is I</i>, <i>be not afraid</i>.&nbsp; Then all
will be calm again&mdash;none can make it calm but the Saviour;
to him let us look, in him let us hope, life has all power in
heaven and in earth, and none can stay his hand, or say, What
doest thou?&nbsp; I hope we shall yet see better days, and live
more to God&rsquo;s glory.&nbsp; This we cannot do without more
grace, and when we feel what poor sinners we are, then is the
time to pray for more grace.&nbsp; It is not enough to be
convinced we are sinners, but we must know we are pardoned
sinners, and as we receive this knowledge, so our sins are
subdued.&nbsp; Nothing can so truly subdue sin, as the hope, or
the full assurance they are forgiven.&nbsp; I hope the Lord is
shewing you what you are in yourself, humbling you with the most
blessed views of Christ, and at times giving you a spirit of
prayer, and of hearing, and tho&rsquo; you are not able to read
much, yet I trust many sweet texts of scripture come to your
mind, to encourage you to hope for salvation, through the doing
and dying of Christ.&nbsp; I hope you will be led to know more of
Christ <a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
107</span>and his precious salvation, more of his person and
work, by the teaching of the Holy Spirit, that you may feel the
earnests of heaven.&nbsp; The Lord has promised we shall know
him, from the least to the greatest, that he will be merciful to
our souls, and that we shall be satisfied with his favour.&nbsp;
This is all that is worth living for, and as it is to his glory,
so we glorify him by seeking after this.</p>
<p>I have many precious moments in this place alone.&nbsp; I find
the Saviour very dear to my heart, and though I am much
distressed at times about my family, on whose account I weep in
secret very bitterly, and also about my friends, who have been
persecuted for my sake.&nbsp; These things grieve my soul, but
yet I have much to be thankful for.&nbsp; All the persons I am
situated with, treat me with great respect, and my dear friends
supply my wants.&nbsp; Thus I am favored, time is on the wing,
eternity and heaven draws near, we shall soon have done with all
temporal things, and God will then fill every power of the
soul.&nbsp; May your life be in faith, and your death
glorious.&nbsp; May God be with you, and among many mercies, may
you be thankful the Lord has blessed you with so good a master
and mistress, who indulges you with an opportunity of hearing the
Gospel&mdash;what would I have given for such a situation
once.&nbsp; May the Saviour bless them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lawson</span>.</p>
<p><span class="GutSmall">MY DEAR BROTHER</span> in the <span
class="GutSmall">GREAT HEAD</span> of the <span
class="GutSmall">CHURCH</span>.</p>
<p>In your kind visit to me last Sunday, you dropped a word which
I caught, on that very important text which has sometimes
troubled some of God&rsquo;s dear children, 66th Psalm, 18th
verse, &ldquo;If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not
hear me.&rdquo;&nbsp; The reason why the children of the most
high are staggered about this text, is because they are the
unhappy subjects of the body of sin and death&mdash;of course,
they feel those strong propensities to sin, of every kind, a
carnal nature, with which they are tried, they feel lusts or
desires after that which is contrary to God&mdash;in their flesh
or <i>old man</i>, there is nothing that is good.&nbsp; This
flesh does not mean the body.&nbsp; For there are many good
things in that vessel.&nbsp; There is a regenerated soul, there
are principles of grace, there is the Holy Spirit in it, as his
own temple.&nbsp; But the flesh, the carnal part of an elect
person, as regenerated, is distinct from both the body and the
soul; yet both are at times influenced, led captive, overcome and
ensnared by this plague, this burden, this grief, this old man,
so called by the Apostle, and by Solomon called a strange woman,
against which, he, in the person of Christ, cautions his children
in many places in the book of Proverbs.&nbsp; The worst part we
feel of this evil principle, is the sinful desires for sensual
and carnal gratifications.&nbsp; This was the way-faring man, who
came to David, and would not <a name="page109"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 109</span>be satisfied without the ewe lamb;
and this same traveller often visits us; for though he is an
inmate with God&rsquo;s children, yet through the reign of Grace,
he is not our king, ruler, or associate.&nbsp; The grace of God
has altered all our minds, took the throne of our hearts, and
reigns king here.&nbsp; For thus runs the covenant promise, Sin
shall not have the dominion over you, grace shall reign.&nbsp; We
have fell out with sin, we have another nature which hates sin,
nor can it ever entertain it more.&nbsp; We hate iniquity by the
holy principle in us.&nbsp; This iniquity which the Psalmist
refers to, I humbly conceive, means those awful principles of
pride, and self-righteousness, in which mankind are involved, and
by which they deceive their souls.&nbsp; I need not remind you of
the distinction between transgression and iniquity; the one
refers to the out-breakings of sin into acts of immorality; the
other refers to the carnal ambitious principles of free-will,
independence, and self-sufficiency.&nbsp; David had seen an end
of perfection, by the application of the law; he had been in the
horrible pit, and miry clay, and had been led to see that his own
righteousness could not bear the strict scrutiny of God&rsquo;s
justice, and that in God&rsquo;s sight, no flesh living could be
justified, by any thing they could do.&nbsp; His mind was fixed
on the adorable Redeemer, as his surety, mediator, righteousness,
and intercessor&mdash;here his heart was fixed, trusting on this
he lived and died.&nbsp; Through this medium alone, his soul had
access to God, his prayers were heard and answered, his requests
were received, and his petitions granted.&nbsp; This was an
evidence that he had an holy principle within him that hated
iniquity, although he had an opposite principle within him that
did regard iniquity.&nbsp; The Lord looks upon us as we are in
Christ, and as we are under the <a name="page110"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 110</span>reign of grace, which destroys the
reign of sin, transgression, and iniquity.&nbsp; David hated all
the works of the flesh, and above all, those cursed principles
which are in opposition to the humiliating doctrines of the
Gospel, which teach men to look to, trust in, and make their own
works, either in whole or in part, a Saviour.&nbsp; The Lord had
appeared to David, as a prayer-answering God; this was an
undeniable proof that he did not regard iniquity in his
regenerated soul, and every answer to prayer which we receive, is
a most blessed evidence to us, that grace has done the same for
us which it did for David.&nbsp; Hence he acknowledges the mercy,
in the two following verses.&nbsp; I beg you to read the
connection from 16th verse to the close.&nbsp; But my dear
friend, may we not look a little higher than David or any chosen
vessel; may not this passage belong to David&rsquo;s Lord, of
whom he speaks throughout the book of Psalms.&nbsp; Was not his
nature entirely free from sin and iniquity; was he not holy,
harmless, and undefiled, separated and free from iniquity as God
himself; and if he had not been so, he could not have made an
atonement for his Church, nor wrought out a righteousness for
them; but having completed the work, by his interest he obtained
the gift of the Holy Ghost, to abide in and with his people for
ever.&nbsp; In this view, only read over the above verse, and you
will see a peculiar glory in them, in reference to Christ.&nbsp;
May he be very dear to your heart, living and dying; may you be
led to his person and work, and feel joy and peace in believing
in the love which God hath for you in Christ.</p>

a preacher does not stand manifest to your conscience, you cannot
hear him, nor can I blame you.&nbsp; The time of my deliverance I
hope will come, when I trust to meet the Lord&rsquo;s people once
more, and abide with them, till sickness and death finally
separate.</p>
<p>The second chapter of Isaiah is a very grand and solemn part
of God&rsquo;s word.&nbsp; I have no commentators here to explain
it, but hope the Lord will give me a little light into it, as I
write this short note on it, particularly that important address,
in the 10th verse, which you beg a few thoughts on.&nbsp; The
compass of a very long letter, would be too short to set forth
one half the beauties and excellencies contained in this part of
sacred writ.&nbsp; The prophet Isaiah is supposed to be the most
evangelical of all the prophets, not, but all the rest wrote of
the same grand object, Christ, but this great man was led more
deeply into the subject.&nbsp; He lived under the reigns of
several kings, and died a martyr, under the reign of
Manasseh.&nbsp; It is supposed he was sawn asunder with a wooden
saw.&nbsp; He was led most divinely to see the person, glory,
love, work, and the kingdom of Christ, the nature of the Gospel
dispensation, and the peculiar happiness of the Church, <a
name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>in the
first dawn of that period, and its full meridian in the latter
day glory.&nbsp; To these distant times, he, no doubt, alludes in
the five first verses of this chapter.&nbsp; The conquests of
grace, is particularly pointed out in the 4th verse.&nbsp; When
Christ, to whom all judgment is given, shall reign in the power
of his Gospel, in every part of the world, and when fierce
persecutors, who have been as swords and spears against the
saints, those being converted, should be made useful characters
in the Lord&rsquo;s garden.&nbsp; We are exhorted to walk in the
light of the gospel, and perhaps our Lord, and his servant John,
alludes to this text in their several addresses to the saints, in
the Gospel and Epistles of John.&nbsp; We may, with propriety,
call Isaiah the Old Testament Apostle&mdash;such were his clear
views of Christ, that one would think we were reading a history
of circumstances past, more than a prophesy of what was to come,
although he lived, probably, seven hundred years before the
events themselves took place.&nbsp; The prophet then proceeds,
from the 6th verse of this chapter, and the following verses, to
predict the desolation of Jerusalem, for those sins which had so
much displeased the Lord, particularly the reigning sin of
idolatry, to which the Jews were so awfully prone.&nbsp; This
prophecy may allude to the first captivity, by Nebuchadnezzar,
which was a very desolating siege, but more particularly to the
destruction of the city and temple of Jerusalem, by the Roman
armies, for their rejection of the Gospel, the murder of the Son
of God, and their persecution of the apostles and ministers of
Christ.&nbsp; The Jews were all wedded to their own works, and
trusting in them, is idolatry.&nbsp; This was their base conduct,
both rich and poor, therefore the Lord was determined to break up
house-keeping with them, and devote the <a
name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>whole land
to destruction; and such should be the terrors of the siege, that
the prophet is commanded to direct the attention of many to the
holes of the rocks and caves of the earth&mdash;such should be
horrors experienced by all the inhabitants of Judea, from the
terrible majesty of Jehovah, when he should shake the earth with
his awful vengeance.&nbsp; This subject is again and again
repeated, to shew its certainty and its horror, a faint shadow of
the last great day, when our God shall appear in grandeur, our
world shall be in flames, when consternation shall turn every
unprepared heart pale as the second death, 24th Matthew; and the
6th of Revelations should be read with this chapter, but I humbly
conceive this address in the 10th verse, may be applied to
God&rsquo;s children, who should live to see these awful times,
and indeed, viewed in a gospel sense, there is no period when the
exhortation is needless.&nbsp; We are sinners, guilty, polluted,
undone, and hell-deserving.&nbsp; God, as viewed in the law, is
truly awful.&nbsp; He appears, and every truly awakened soul sees
him, and dreads him as a sin-avenging God, who will by no means
of man&rsquo;s devising, clear the guilty.&nbsp; The sinner who
is under the hand of the law, feels the intolerable burden of his
own sins, views the holiness of God, the extent and spirituality
of the commandments, and groans under fearful apprehensions of
eternal woe, and who finds he can do nothing but sin in thought,
word, and deed, notwithstanding all his vows, watchings, and
care; yet his mind apprehending the faithfulness and
unchangeableness of God, who has declared, The soul that sinneth,
it shall die.&nbsp; This awful perfection dwells on his mind, and
the horrors, real and imaginary, seize his spirits.&nbsp; Here he
feels the evil of sin, the terrors of the Almighty, the nature of
the law, the impossibility <a name="page114"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 114</span>of being saved by it, the awful
state of all who are out of Christ, however moral their
deportment, or clear their doctrinal views.&nbsp; Here a soul
sees his need of a surety, his need of a better righteousness
than his own, his need of an atonement, and a Saviour, who is
God-Man Mediator.&nbsp; This is learning the subject from real
heart felt experience; and this explains many passages in the
Bible, descriptive of the feelings of many who were brought into
this state.&nbsp; This is being planted into the likeness of
Christ&rsquo;s death, and when such souls are brought into the
liberty of the gospel, they know, even if they cannot explain,
what it is to be planted into the likeness of his resurrection
also.&nbsp; Now to all such tried souls, exercised with the
terrors of God, and fearing his wrath and terrible majesty, as a
sin-avenging God, to all such is the address made, Enter into the
rock, and hide thee in the dust.&nbsp; When the prophet Jeremiah
was exercised, with some awful impressions of the divine majesty,
he describes a soul made so willing to see his interest in
pardoning mercy, that he putteth his mouth in the dust.&nbsp; If
so be there may be hope, the lowest place that can be, suits such
an one, yea, in the very dust, pleading for mercy and pardon,
through the blood of the Lamb, and his law-fulfilling
righteousness.&nbsp; I have often been in this state; and perhaps
the prophet refers to such a state in the 29th chapter, 4th
verse, And thy speech shall whisper out of the dust.&nbsp; This,
although many miseries are experienced, is a safe state; but none
can believe that we are thus exercised, till God raises the poor
from the dust, and the needy from the dunghill.&nbsp; See 113
Psalm, 1st of Samuel, ii, 7, 8.&nbsp; The command is, Enter into
the rock.&nbsp; There is no safety but in him, he is the rock,
and his work is perfect.&nbsp; He is the high, holy, fruitful, <a
name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>refreshing,
foundation; shelter, safety, defence, and strength of his
church.&nbsp; Here many a soul has run, and found safety, help,
comfort, and peace: this is the only dwelling place for a
law-condemned sinner, who has fled for refuge; here alone is
firm, floating, and solid peace, all, all is sea beside.&nbsp; I
must refer you to that blessed circumstance, recorded in 33rd
Exodus, and the close of the chapter.&nbsp; This will greatly
assist your spiritual views of the passage under
consideration.&nbsp; It is only in Christ we can see the glory of
God.&nbsp; To enter in, is the mind enabled by God the
Spirit&rsquo;s power, to receive the truth, and to be led by the
same Spirit to apprehend the Lord Jesus Christ, as he is
revealed.&nbsp; This is the truth that makes us free, hand as it
enters into the mind, so we sweetly enter into it.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Lawson</span>,</p>
<p><span class="GutSmall">MY VERY DEAR FRIEND</span>,</p>
<p>With grief of heart I have to inform you, that poor Dean is
appointed to die on Thursday morning.&nbsp; This is a most
distressing circumstance, as I know the poor fellow entertained a
hope that it would be proved an act of insanity.&nbsp; My
feelings will be sorely distressed, as I shall have the pain to
hear his poor trembling footsteps on the scaffold.&nbsp; May God
prepare his soul, <a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
116</span>and assure him of his interest in Christ.&nbsp; May he
feel the pardoning love of God&mdash;this will be as pillars of
marble, to support his sinking heart.&nbsp; Oh that he may be
washed in the dear Redeemer&rsquo;s blood, and clothed with his
righteousness, that he may be accepted of the Father the moment
the soul quits the body.&nbsp; Glad should I be to visit him, and
pray with him, but that is not allowed.&nbsp; Last night I was
very low about him, and suddenly opened upon the 37th Psalm, The
Lord will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when he is
judged.&nbsp; If his last letter to me was genuine, he is saved
in the Lord, with an everlasting salvation.&nbsp; His soul is
every thing now, the body will soon be lifeless.&nbsp; Solemn
thought, affecting idea&mdash;to be cut off by an untimely death,
in the height of health and manhood!&nbsp; How truly awful; what
has sin done, and Oh how great is the power of Satan.&nbsp; The
Lord will put an end to the empire of Satan, and confine him down
to darkness, fire, and chains, and we shall say Amen to
Satan&rsquo;s sentence.&nbsp; I trust poor Dean has found mercy
at the hands of God.&nbsp; Various letters I have sent him, and
glad I am the Lord enabled me to point him to the bleeding
cross.&nbsp; His first letter to me, was a proof his mind was
very dark, and his last letter proves his increase in light and
faith; if the Lord has thus blessed my poor letters to him, you
and I can see that I was not sent here in vain.&nbsp; It is well,
the Lord has many means to bring his children to the knowledge of
the truth.&nbsp; What God did to Pharaoh, and his host, reached
the ear of Rahab the harlot, in Jericho, and she was
converted.&nbsp; The fame of Solomon&rsquo;s wisdom was heard in
the country of the Sabeans, and proved the conversion of the
queen of Sheba.&nbsp; The wonderful destruction of the Assyrian
army, reached to Babylon, <a name="page117"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 117</span>from thence came the wise men to
worship Christ, and a church was formed there.&nbsp; A famine
drove Naomi from Bethlehem, and she carried the knowledge of the
true God to the country of Moab, which proved the conversion of
Ruth.&nbsp; The Syrians invaded Israel, and took a little maid
captive, which terminated in the conversion of Namaan.&nbsp; A
famine drove Elijah to a widow at Zidon, and Elisha&rsquo;s
passing by a house at Shunem, proved their conversion.&nbsp; Paul
and Silas were taken up, and put in prison, and Onesimus was
confined in the same place for felony, and Paul was the means of
his conversion there.&nbsp; A person swore that against me which
I knew nothing about, and I was doomed to this place for a
time.&nbsp; I dread the approach of Thursday, the shock will be
great, but it will be soon over; and then, O what a
transition&mdash;what bliss will his spirit feel, and what
gratitude to God for bringing him home from an ignominious death,
to eternal life.&nbsp; I have been informed Mr. Hyat, of the
Tabernacle, visited him several times, and those visits have been
blessed to his soul.&nbsp; I find faith and patience wants
strengthening, but all fullness is in Christ.&nbsp; I am glad
prayer is making in the Church for Mr. D.</p>

118</span>LETTER XXXV.</h2>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Valley of Achor</i>, <i>May</i>
8<i>th</i>, 1819.</p>
<p>Mrs. O,</p>
<p><span class="GutSmall">MY DEAR FRIEND</span>,</p>
<p>I well know your concern about the state of poor Mr. D.&nbsp;
Yourself and your dear sister&mdash;dear indeed by a three-fold
cord of nature, grace and trials, have expressed much anxiety for
some information on the subject of his conversion and end.&nbsp;
I have but few materials to furnish you with that account, as my
situation precluded all intercourse with him, except by letter
and a distant view of each other.&nbsp; This was no small matter
of sorrow to me, for many weeks, nor could I often help
exclaiming in the pathetic language of Jeremiah, &ldquo;Truly
this is a grief, but must I bear it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some time ago, I wrote a few lines to your dear sister, giving
her an account of the death of three unhappy men (see Letter 19)
but as I could gain no satisfaction about them, sufficient to
call your attention to admire that grace, which I was informed
they were favored with, I left the subject.&nbsp; God forbid that
I should exercise more charity to dying men, than the Lord has
manifested.&nbsp; I am well convinced that the Judge of all the
earth will do right; and although he giveth not account of his
matters, yet the day will declare his righteousness, and every
dark and mysterious providence will be unfolded; let us therefore
wait the great teacher, Death, and God adore.&nbsp; I am not
enraptured with the various accounts of the closing scene of <a
name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>many, nor
am I moved with the darkness to which God&rsquo;s dear people may
be liable at the end of their warfare; all was darkness when the
eternal Son of God was dying, yet, he was the Son of God, and
Satan may be permitted to harrass a believer to the very gates of
heaven; yet thousands are deluded to the last moment, whose hopes
are built upon the sand, and whose religion sinks with their
lives, when their false refuges and lying confidences give
way.&nbsp; Many profane graceless characters die like lambs, but
Oh, could we see what terrors surround them upon its approach to
an angry God, in the world of spirits, it would harrow up our
very souls.&nbsp; Many proud pharisees, who are trusting in
themselves that they are righteous, that they are better than
others, die in the same state.&nbsp; Many flaming, professors,
who boast they have done much for God, and his cause, find in
death that God has done nothing for them; and those who only have
received the system of truth in the notion, and yet destitute of
its power, are in the same awful state.&nbsp; Many who have come
to an ignominious end, have been left to die with a lie in their
mouths, declaring their innocence of their crimes; and others
have patched up a peace with God, as they call it, by a little
sorrow for sin, the receiving the sacrament, by forgiving their
enemies, and dying in peace with all the world.&nbsp; These are
some of the various delusions, in which many of our poor fallen
race leave this world for eternity; but I am happy to say, that I
believe many have gone from the fatal drop to endless bliss, who
have been convinced of sin, cried for mercy in God&rsquo;s way,
and obtained a sense of pardoning mercy through the doing and
dying of the adorable Mediator.&nbsp; This has inspired a holy
confidence in the mind, that maketh not ashamed, a hope that
cannot fail, as it centers <a name="page120"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 120</span>in the person and finished work of
Christ.&nbsp; Great indeed has been the false confidence of
many.&nbsp; Mary, queen of Scots, a rigid papist, went to the
block to be beheaded, in a strong confidence.&nbsp; Rosseau, the
infidel philosopher, died as calm as a summer&rsquo;s evening
breeze, and the celebrated Addison said in death, &ldquo;See in
what tranquility a christian can die;&rdquo; and yet, alas! what
was the ground of their hopes?&nbsp; But the person who is the
subject of this letter, was indeed better taught, and we must
appeal to the church and the world on his behalf, and say,
&ldquo;Is not this a brand plucked out of the fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is a mercy to find the Pearl of great Price in early life,
as it saves the soul from a thousand thorns, which gall the
consciences of those, who do not experience the pardon of their
sins till the terrors of death approach.&nbsp; The Lord has given
us one particular instance in his word, of the victory of his
grace in the soul, as the body was wracking in the agonies of
death, and this is recorded that none might despair, and none
might presume.&nbsp; Two malefactors were crucified with our dear
Lord, on Golgotha; and when impious profane wretches, with the
hell-hardened priests, were insulting him in his agonies, thieves
that were crucified with him, did cast the same in his
teeth.&nbsp; This shews the awful state they were both in, but
Oh, the freeness and sovereignty of divine grace&mdash;the Lord
selected one of those to be an instance of it&mdash;at this awful
period the Lord Jesus looked upon him, and began his work of
grace; the effects were soon visible, in reproving his companion,
and submission to his fate, the acknowledgment of his just
sentence, with a high commendation of the illustrious
sufferer.&nbsp; This was <a name="page121"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 121</span>presently vented again in prayer,
crying first to his companion in sin and sorrow, &ldquo;Dost thou
not fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?&nbsp; We
indeed, justly suffer, but this man hath done nothing
amiss.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then perhaps writhing his agonising body
towards his Redeemer, he strove to shew his veneration, by lowly
bowing his head.&nbsp; The effort tore his lengthening wounds,
and the blood gushed forth in larger streams; but disregarding
the pain, and the streaming blood, he cried, &ldquo;Lord,
remember me, when thou comest into thy kingdom.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
dear Saviour, with a divine smile, which entered the heart of the
poor malefactor, looked on him with benignity, grace, and love;
and with a gentle voice replied, &ldquo;This day shalt thou be
with me in Paradise.&rdquo;&nbsp; No doubt this sweet promise was
attended with the full pardon of his sins, a sense of divine
love, and a joy full of glory.&nbsp; The peace of God, which his
dear Lord was now making for him, filled his wondering mind, and
fitted his new-born soul for celestial triumphs.&nbsp; Here was
grace indeed&mdash;sovereign, rich, and free.&nbsp; He saw his
Redeemer in agonies, he beheld the midnight darkness which veiled
the heavens, he felt the earth quake, and he heard the rocks
split when his Lord exclaimed &ldquo;It is finished.&rdquo;&nbsp;
No doubt with strange emotions of love, grief, wonder, capture,
surprise, adoration, and joy, he cast his dying eyes on his
suffering Saviour; he saw our Jesus bow his dear head in death,
having obtained eternal redemption for all who come to God
through him; and no doubt he longed for the moment when he should
breathe his last&mdash;but his heart was once more to be
broken.&nbsp; The soldiers came to break the legs of the
malefactors, but his Lord was dead already; and the poor thief,
with dim dying eyes; yet saw the murderous villain <a
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>drive a
spear in the heart of that Christ that had pardoned his sin; his
soul struggled to get through the body, to the bosom of its
Saviour and its God.&nbsp; His legs being broken, he then
expired, and his disimprisoned soul fled to the paradise promised
him.&nbsp; This was grace indeed.</p>
<blockquote><p>Oh for this love let rocks and hills<br />
Their lasting silence break.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This almighty grace, I humbly trust, accomplished the
salvation of Mr. D.&nbsp; It appears from what I can learn, that
he had lived in thoughtlessness and folly, and those amusements
which are calculated to fasten the bands of spiritual death the
firmer; but the Lord stopped him in his mad career, in a very
awful way, and with one tremendous sin, punished others, and made
it an awful, but gracious means to bring him to reflection, to
seeking the Lord, and to that repentance that needeth not to be
repented of.&nbsp; Sin rose to its heighth, Satan did his utmost,
and the hand of the Lord appeared; the awful moment of temptation
came, he complied, he sinned with an high hand and an uplifted
arm&mdash;ignorant of the nature of sin, he vainly supposed a
child wanted no Saviour, forgetting it is written, &ldquo;I was
shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; He performed the fatal act, and ushered the soul
of the child into eternity, destroyed its body, robbed its dear
parents of its affectionate embrace, involved them in sorrow, and
plunged himself into the deepest horrors, real and imaginary;
forfeited his life to the just laws of his country, and if grace
had not been manifested, he would have complicated his own
everlasting destruction.&nbsp; Oh, the extent of the crime! how
dreadful!&nbsp; His tortured heart could feel no rest day <a
name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>nor night,
till he gave himself up to justice.&nbsp; I saw him come into
prison, and strange to tell, I felt a spirit of prayer for him
influence my mind, which, more or less, abode with me till his
execution.&nbsp; I knew how it would be with him, and I daily
feared he would die by his own hands; but the Lord appeared
gracious, not only in preserving him, but in giving him a serious
concern about his never dying soul.&nbsp; There was a person in
the same class with him, who had been for some time also with me;
this person often took occasion to talk seriously with Mr. *** D.
and observing the state of his mind, he advised him to write to
me; but I being a stranger to him, and his mind sadly agitated,
he requested his companion to write to me, and lay before me his
distressed feelings, and begged to know from me if there were any
hopes held out in scripture, for such a character as he was, and
if there were any murderer ever obtained eternal life.&nbsp; I
endeavored to answer him according to the word of God, assured
him I was glad to find him under concern for his soul, and asking
the way to God.&nbsp; I pointed out the nature and design of the
Gospel, in the revelation of a Saviour, exactly suited to such
sinners as he was; the invitation to poor sinners, who were led
to cry for mercy from a feeling sense of need; the freeness of
divine grace, and above all, I constantly urged the necessity of
an application of the atonement to the conscience, and shewed him
according to my poor abilities, that the salvation he now stood
in need of, consisted in the sense of pardoning mercy.&nbsp; This
I urged upon him to cry day and night for, and never rest till he
knew for himself his sins were forgiven, and then I knew all the
happy holy consequences that would follow.</p>
<p><a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>I
next pointed out the excellency of the good and just laws of the
land in which we live, and although I was most cruelly charged as
an enemy to all laws, divine and human, yet this was as false as
God was true, as I consider the wholesome laws of the country, to
come the nearest to the precepts of the sacred scriptures, and
that a Christian, in his best state of mind, esteemed and loved
every law of God.&nbsp; Great peace have they which love thy
law.&nbsp; The next step I took, was to point out those parts of
scripture, which suited his case and this I constantly enforced,
as I hoped he grew in knowledge, and in seeking the Lord; but I
did not answer the question in reference to the possibility of a
murderer&rsquo;s salvation, for some time after, because I
considered it necessary that he should be truly wounded, till the
healing balm was brought.</p>
<p>I shall not enlarge upon the subject of the various letters I
sent him in his unhappy situation, but with respect to the
question, &ldquo;The doubt in the minds of many, whether it is
possible for a person guilty of murder, to obtain eternal
life:&rdquo; The scriptures are clear upon this subject.&nbsp;
Many have obtained it, although they most justly forfeit their
natural lives, agreeable to the divine injunction, &ldquo;Whoso
sheddeth man&rsquo;s blood, by man shall his blood be
shed.&rdquo;&nbsp; And if a murderer is not detected and executed
by the laws of his country, yet, in general, some evil befals
them, and they seldom die a natural death; for the word of God is
mostly fulfilled in this particular.&nbsp; But, with respect to
the soul, the salvation of that is an act of free, sovereign
mercy.&nbsp; The passage of John&rsquo;s Epistle, 3rd chapter,
15th verse, should be read in its connexion, and you will find
that it explains itself, &ldquo;Whoever <a
name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>hateth his
brother is a murderer, and ye know that no murderer hath eternal
life abiding in him.&rdquo;&nbsp; This text refers to those
hypocrites in a profession of religion, who, in heart, hate those
that are truly called of God to the enjoyment of the truth; and
such, indeed, is the nature of the holy law of God, that it views
unjust anger in the mind, as murder; so says the Lord and
fulfiller of his own law, 5th of Matthew.&nbsp; Who then can hope
for salvation from the broken Covenant of Works; but it is very
evident that some who have committed murder have been pardoned by
the blood of the atonement, and are now in heaven.&nbsp;
God&rsquo;s highly distinguished servants, both Moses and David,
were guilty of Murder; Moses killed an Egyptian and hid him in
the sand, and David gave orders to captain-general Joab to place
Uriah in the front of the battle, that he might be killed; this
cruel act was resented by the Lord, for although his sins were
pardoned, yet David had a broken heart within, and perpetual wars
without.&nbsp; While Manasseh was in a state of nature, it is
said he wrought <i>very much evil</i> in the sight of the
Lord&mdash;moreover, Manasseh shed innocent blood <i>very
much</i>&mdash;and yet, Oh the wonders of free victorious
grace!&nbsp; Manasseh is brought into trouble, into a prison, and
into fetters, and there the Lord convinced him of sin, humbled
his heart, gave him a spirit of prayer, and made himself known to
him as a sin pardoning God.&nbsp; Some of the murderers of the
Son of God were pardoned: for these the dear Saviour prayed,
while they were in the very act of crucifying him, &ldquo;Father
forgive them.&rdquo;&nbsp; And when the bold and faithful apostle
Peter preached to them, he charged the murder of the Saviour to
their consciences, God gave them faith to believe in him, grace
to receive his word, repentance unto life, <a
name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>and they
were baptized in the name of that very Jesus whom they had
crucified.&nbsp; I might also mention Saul of Tarsus, who gives a
most affecting account of himself, in the 26th of the Acts.&nbsp;
And who can tell the list of those who have been humbled and
renewed by the grace of God, and who went from the fatal gibbet
to glory?&nbsp; This I trust was the sad, but through mercy,
happy case with Mr. D.</p>
<p>After the lapse of a few weeks, when his agitated bosom would
permit him, he wrote to me&mdash;there was nothing in his letter
but what was very natural to expect from a person in his
situation; yet, from a few sentences, I was encouraged in my hope
that he was seeking the Lord.&nbsp; I gained information of him
every week, and always wrote to him accordingly.&nbsp; His fears,
terrors, and horrors overwhelmed his trembling spirit, and I
hoped there was more than nature in it.&nbsp; Some pious men
brought him some religions Tracts.&nbsp; Good Mr. Smith of
Penzance, once visited him, and by the good hand of God, his
terrors abated, and his mind was gradually opened by the Holy
Spirit, to see the value of Christ, and to make application to
him for that mercy and grace he delights to display.&nbsp; I
frequently observed him at the chapel, and when our worthy
Chaplain advanced any precious sentence of the fullness and
freeness of grace, he used to look at me with smiling
approbation; by this I could see he was, at least, gaining some
knowledge of the right way, and rejoicing in the truth.&nbsp; He
experienced very violent temptations from the enemy, sometimes to
suicide, then to doubt the authenticity of the Bible.&nbsp;
Various were his tossings of mind and deep was his distress, till
the Lord led him to receive the atonement in his mind with power;
this was <a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
127</span>done in the use of the means.&nbsp; I could humbly wish
to have known <i>how</i> this came into his mind, whether by the
impression of any scripture, or in any open manifestation of
power, light, and liberty.&nbsp; I heard he was more comfortable
than he used to be, and wrote to him to know the ground of that
comfort, and the real state of his mind, to which he sent me the
following simple and plain Letter.</p>
<blockquote><p>Mr. C.</p>
<p><span class="GutSmall">MY DEAR FRIEND &amp; WELL
WISHER</span>,</p>
<p>I feel much indebted to you for your good advice and kind
attention to me under my heavy afflictions.&nbsp; I have the
pleasure to inform you I am a wonder to myself: my mind and heart
prone after the riches of Christ&mdash;there is no name under
heaven, nor in heaven, so precious as <i>his</i> to me.&mdash;You
know what the Bible promises to all believers.&nbsp; I have read
it, and thought it reached any case but mine, but now, thanks be
to God, I find my case and sins were what our blessed Saviour
shed his blood for&mdash;<i>such rebels as me</i>!&nbsp; A free
pardon is held forth for such vile creatures as I am.&nbsp; I
thank God from my heart, he has done a great work for
me&mdash;the blood of Christ is precious blood&mdash;he is
strengthening me much in faith.&nbsp; I find he is all I
need.&nbsp; I am nothing but sin, and have done no good in all my
life, yet he holds a free pardon for me.&nbsp; He has answered my
polluted prayers, and every promise in the book tells me it is
for me.&nbsp; The blessed and Holy Spirit has opened my blind
eyes, and shewed me what I am and what Christ is, in some degree,
but his riches and mercies none can fathom&mdash;his promise
takes away the <a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
128</span>sting of death.&nbsp; I am looking to him, and put all
things into his hands, and it will be well.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Kind Sir, I remain, your&rsquo;s,
&amp;c.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">A great Sinner,<br />
<b><i>R. Dean</i></b>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From this simple letter I received some degree of consolation,
and finding his mind was open to receive the atonement for the
pardon of all sin, I judged it now expedient to lead his
attention to that glorious robe of imputed righteousness which is
the end of the law and the glory of the gospel, that he might be
able to say</p>
<blockquote><p>Jesus thy blood and righteousness<br />
My beauty are my glorious dress;<br />
&rsquo;Midst flaming worlds, in these array&rsquo;d,<br />
With joy shall I lift up my head.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I pressed his attention to that capital blessing, knowing that
faith had to do with that alone to render us just before God;
that while the blood of Jesus took away all sin, the obedience of
Christ to the Law fulfilled all righteousness&mdash;the one
excludes from hell, but the other brings us to heaven; &ldquo;For
in the Lord shall all the Seed of Israel be justified, and shall
glory.&rdquo;&nbsp; I had, after this, much uneasiness of mind on
behalf of poor Mr. D. his situation with so many awful
characters, in the same part of the prison, I knew was not very
favorable to his growth in grace; yet I knew, if the work was
genuine on his mind, it would be carried on; but some persons had
attempted to console his mind with this idea, That on his trial
it would be proved he was insane.&nbsp; I feared this would throw
him into <a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
129</span>a careless frame about his soul, and I fear it did for
a time, but the speedy approach of the assize alarmed him, and I
hope the Lord quickened him again.&nbsp; I wrote to him not to
listen to any such ideas for a moment, and reminded him of the
first intimation of Satan to out first parents&mdash;&ldquo;Ye
shall not surely die.&rdquo;&nbsp; I trust this had the desired
effect; he was tried and cast for death, as I expected, and his
fatal day was appointed, but deferred to wait the decision of the
fate of another, who was afterwards reprieved.&nbsp; This was
indeed rather an uncommon circumstance, but I fondly hoped the
Lord had so appointed it, that poor Mr. D. might be the better
capacitated to enter into his awful presence.&nbsp; In reference
to his state of mind, during this period, the worthy minister of
the place constantly visited him, and held forth the suitable
consolations of the gospel to his view, nor were those visits in
vain.&nbsp; I frequently heard Mr. D. pray aloud, and with much
energy.&nbsp; The day before his execution (April 7, 1819) he was
visited by a Nobleman and his respectable Friend, who, in
imitation of their divine Lord, delights to go about doing good;
may God prosper their efforts, and another day fulfil in those
honorable persons all those gracious promises in the 41st Psalm,
1, 2, 3rd verses.&nbsp; Some pious, Friends from the Methodist
Society often visited him, and prayed with him, and I trust felt
the presence of the Lord with them; as an evidence of his
approbation of their work of love, some continued with him all
the night previous to his execution: Mr. D. received them kindly
and gratefully.&nbsp; The visitors did not perceive the least
sign of insanity, but a calm composedness of mind, and an humble
trust in the atonement of Christ, and without the shadow of a
doubt of the pardon of his sins.&nbsp; Believe me, I feel an
emotion of gratitude and <a name="page130"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 130</span>tears while I write this.&nbsp; He
could give no account what induced him to commit the horrid deed,
but spoke very composedly on every subject.&nbsp; He joined the
gentlemen in prayer, and singing an hymn&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Behold the bleeding lamb of God,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nail&rsquo;d to the shameful tree;<br />
How vast the love that him constrain&rsquo;d<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To bleed and die for me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>About an hour after, leaning upon the shoulder of one of the
visitors, he requested him to sing that sweet hymn again, in
which he joined them, with a sweet and heavenly frame of mind;
but Satan was to have his last onset, and about the middle of the
night the enemy harrassed him sorely, deep darkness pervaded his
mind, and his heart trembled with fear.&nbsp; The dear friends
perceiving this, advised him to retire and read alone, and they
withdrew to the other end of the room.&nbsp; After he had read a
little, he fell on his knees, and prayed most fervently,
consistently, and scripturally.&nbsp; Satan left him, and his
mind became quite serene.&nbsp; At seven in the morning, when he
was preparing all things necessary for his final departure, he
addressed a fellow prisoner in a most surprizing and affecting
manner; spoke of the mercy he had received, and encouraged him to
call on God for pardoning mercy, through the doing and dying of
the Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp; The visitors then read a letter from
his dear friend, the uncle of the dear child, in which he praised
God for the mercy Mr. D. had found, and from the tenor of the
letter, we trust the day dawns on his mind, and the day star
begins to shine.</p>
<p>Mr. D. attended the solemn service at the chapel, <a
name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>and
received the Lord&rsquo;s supper; not to make his peace with God,
but in thankfulness to his dear Lord who had made it for him on
mount Calvary.&nbsp; The solemn bell announced his approach, and
my soul was overwhelmed with solemn grief, which I endeavored to
vent out in prayers and tears.&nbsp; At nine o&rsquo;Clock I
heard him, having ascended the scaffold, in supplication, which
increased in fervent entreaties, and committing his soul into the
hands of the Redeemer.&nbsp; His petitions were earnest and
importunate, and as he increased in agitation, so also in devout
intreaties, crying, Lord Jesus receive my spirit; Look, look upon
a poor murderer.&nbsp; Oh, by the blood of the cross, by the
blood of calvary, look upon me.&nbsp; Lord have mercy upon
me.&nbsp; Lord&mdash; here he was going to speak again, but the
drop fell, and his soul took its flight to the bosom of its
Saviour and its God; with Christ in his heart, heaven in his eye,
and Lord&mdash;on his tongue.&nbsp; Thus died poor Mr. D. a
sinner, saved by grace alone.</p>
<p>I trust his sad case was laid on the hearts of many
God-fearing persons, and many prayers were put up for him, nor
did they return empty.&nbsp; Some of our dear friends had several
precious tokens for his good; and I am happy to say I gave some
hope, that the death of Mr. D. is the means of the spiritual life
of one in the family: perhaps it will not end here.&nbsp; I must
add, that the worthy family to whom the child belonged, most
freely forgave him the rash act, and paid every attention to him
during his confinement.</p>
<p>From this short account of poor Mr. D. I think we may discover
some of those blessed evidences which characterize a real
believer.&nbsp; His brokenness of spirit <a
name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>and honest
confessions, prove his humility before God: his crying day and
night to the Lord, evidence his eternal election; his mind being
led to the Saviour manifested his adoption, and his receiving the
atonement and resting upon Jesus, shewed that his faith was
genuine.&nbsp; His temptations demonstrate Satan&rsquo;s hatred
to him, and his entreaties for mercy to the last moment, prove
that he had obtained mercy: &ldquo;Is not this a brand plucked
out of the fire?&rdquo;&nbsp; I would call your attention in this
letter, to the infinite evil of sin, the mystery of divine
providence, the wonders of almighty grace, and the necessity of
fervent prayer for divine keeping; &ldquo;Hold thou me up, and I
shall be safe;&rdquo; but this would fill a volume.&nbsp; You can
recollect I have observed, that the Lord in general resents a
murder in his own way, and in his own time, although the murderer
may escape condign punishment.&nbsp; This has been proved in many
instances, one of which I have just read in the Methodist
Magazine, which I will just mention in few words.</p>
<p>A gentleman was riding over Hounslow Heath, when a poor man,
with his little boy, ran after him to solicit relief; but the
gentleman refusing, the beggar continued his intreaties, which
aggravated him that he drew his sword and laid the poor beggar on
the ground, and then rode away: the poor boy screamed out that
his father was killed.&nbsp; Ten years after this, as he was
riding near the same place, some boys were playing at cricket,
and one of them hit the gentleman&rsquo;s toe with his
ball.&nbsp; It was painful, and a surgeon at Brentford, told him
it would prove of dangerous consequence.&nbsp; He came to London
for advice, and was informed he must suffer amputation, as a
mortification had actually <a name="page133"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 133</span>taken place.&nbsp; He would not give
his consent to this, and death approached.&nbsp; The doctor asked
him if he knew any thing of the boy who had thrown the ball, and
he said he did, for he well remembered he was the son of the old
man, whom he had killed some years before.&mdash;Verily, there is
a God that judgeth in the earth.</p>

<h3>A DESCRIPTION OF THE PERSON OF JESUS,</h3>
<blockquote><p>As it was found in an Ancient Manuscript, sent by
Publius Lentulus, President of Judea, to the Senate of Rome.</p>
<p><i>There lives at this time in Judea</i>, <i>a Man of singular
Character whose name is Jesus Christ</i>; <i>the barbarians
esteem him as a Prophet</i>, <i>but his own followers adore him
as the immediate offspring of the immortal God</i>.&nbsp; <i>He
is endued with such unparalleled virtue</i>, <i>as to call back
the dead from their graves</i>, <i>and to heal every kind of
disease with a word or a touch</i>.&nbsp; <i>His person is
tall</i>, <i>and elegantly </i><a name="page134"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 134</span><i>shaped</i>, <i>his aspect amiable
and reverend</i>; <i>his hair flows into those beauteous shades
which no united colours can match</i>, <i>falling into graceful
curls below his ears</i>, <i>agreeably couching on his
shoulders</i>, <i>and parting on the crown of his head</i>,
<i>like the head dress of the sect of the Nazarenes</i>.&nbsp;
<i>His forehead is very plain</i>, <i>smooth</i>, <i>and
large</i>, <i>his cheeks without a spot or wrinkle</i>, <i>save
that of a lovely red</i>, <i>his nose and mouth are formed with
exquisite symmetry</i>, <i>his beard is thick</i>, <i>and of a
colour suitable to the hair of his head</i>, <i>reaching a little
below his chin</i>, <i>and parted in the middle like a fork</i>,
<i>his eyes grey</i>, <i>bright and clear</i>, <i>quick and
serene</i>.&nbsp; <i>He rebukes with majesty</i>, <i>counsels
with mildness</i>, <i>pleasant in speech</i>, <i>and invites with
the most tender and persuasive language</i>; <i>his whole
address</i>, <i>whether by word or deed</i>, <i>being courteous
and friendly</i>, <i>elegant</i>, <i>grave</i>, <i>and
characteristic of so exalted a being</i>.&nbsp; <i>No man has
seen him laugh</i>, <i>but the whole world beheld him weep
frequently</i>, <i>and so persuasive are his tears</i>, <i>that
the multitude cannot withhold theirs from joining in sympathy
with his</i>.&nbsp; <i>He is very temperate</i>, <i>modest</i>,
<i>and wise</i>, <i>in short</i>, <i>whatever this
Ph&aelig;nomenon may turn out in the end</i>, <i>he seems</i>,
<i>at present a man</i>, <i>for his excellent beauty and divine
perfections</i>, <i>every way surpassing the Children of
Men</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is certainly a very pretty description of the human
nature of our dear Lord, and I feel half inclined to suppose that
our first parent Adam, was a little like him in person&mdash;this
is only a carnal notion, I acknowledge, but I cannot forbear to
indulge it.&nbsp; The psalmist David, said of Christ, eight
hundred years before he came, &ldquo;Thou art fairer than the
children of men:&rdquo; yet this dear visage and beauty was
marred, spoiled, more than any man&rsquo;s; grief had so affected
him, that when but thirty, he looked like a man of fifty years of
age.&nbsp; He was a man of sorrows, and his most intimate
acquaintance was grief; he saw such an infinite evil in sin, the
hourly insults poured upon God by the whole <a
name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>world; he
saw Jehovah slighted, ridiculed, abused, hated, and opposed; his
whole heart loved Jehovah, and this broke his heart, lay heavy on
his spirits, and caused him to say, as in his own common prayer
book, the Psalms, &ldquo;Rivers of water run down mine eyes,
because men keep not thy law.&rdquo;&nbsp; He saw the dreadful
state his own children were in, and what he had to endure to make
an atonement for them.&nbsp; Every now and then one of his soul
pangs took him; hence we read of his being troubled in spirit,
agitated and troubled in soul.&nbsp; This was some time before
his sufferings in the garden.&nbsp; But while we admire his
outward beauty as man, what vast beauty possessed his
mind&mdash;wisdom, prudence, chastity, holiness, zeal,
understanding, faith, hope, love, and joy; in the
principle&mdash;mercy, commiseration, pity, affection, patience,
gratitude, and fidelity.&nbsp; Look at his actions, and they all
correspond with the holy principles of his mind, and this holy
nature was the image of God, the exemplar pattern and likeness of
the new man of grace in the souls of God&rsquo;s children; but
Oh, what an exalted idea does the sacred pages give us of this
blessed Jesus; he was, he is God-Man.&nbsp; His body was but the
casket, his divinity the rich jewel it contained.&nbsp; He was
united to the Son of God, to God the Son, who is over all, God
blessed for ever.&nbsp; He is God-Man, he possesses every divine
perfection; he is Jehovah, God and Lord; he is stiled, Jehovah
330 times in the old Testament; he is called God 90 times in the
old Testament, and 25 times in the new.&nbsp; He has put away sin
by his obedience and sufferings; he is exalted above the
heavens.&nbsp; How truly beautiful and glorious he appears in the
midst of heaven, wearing our nature, but shining brighter than a
million suns&mdash;the delight of the Father <a
name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>and the
Holy Spirit&mdash;the joy of saints and angels; and whatever was
his appearance on earth, we can form no idea of his human nature
in heaven.&nbsp; God bless you while young, with some very sweet
views of him, that he may be dear to your heart in youth and age,
in life and death.</p>

<h2>LETTER XXXVII.</h2>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Achor&rsquo;s tale</i>,
<i>September</i> 29, 1818.</p>
<p>Mr. G. <span class="smcap">Gray</span>.</p>
<p><span class="GutSmall">MY DEAR BROTHER</span>,</p>
<p>What can I say to you, and how can I sufficiently thank you
for your kindness and benevolence of heart and conduct; well
might the apostle exhort, &ldquo;Let us not love in word and in
tongue, but in deed and in truth;&rdquo; and this has been your
conduct to me since my abode at the sign of the unstrung harp,
near the weeping willows, by the rivers of Babylon.&nbsp; Here I
at present live, but what the Lord promised the Israelites in
captivity, he is most graciously fulfilling in my case.&nbsp; I
need not remind you that <i>Achor</i> was a valley in Jericho,
where Achor the son of Carmi was stoned; perhaps the valley
borrowed its name from the circumstance itself.&nbsp; Achor means
trouble, and you know what is written in your favorite chapter,
2nd of Hosea.&nbsp; What an affecting picture the Lord has given
us of Israel&rsquo;s ingratitude <a name="page137"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 137</span>and rebellion; but having determined
from all eternity, that where sin hath abounded, there grace also
should much more abound, and triumph over all the sin of his
people, which has brought them into so much trouble, as Achan did
the Israelites, that in the very midst of that valley of Achor,
he would open a door of hope, and give them strong consolations;
that there he would manifest his pardoning love, display his
eternal power, sanctify the cross to them, reveal his love to the
heart, and though in the very midst of trouble, yet his people
should sing of his mercy, truth, faithfulness, kindness, and
righteousness, all which are displayed in their marriage union to
Christ, the date of which is as ancient as eternal
election.&nbsp; The grand displays of it was in the great act of
the Redeemer&rsquo;s incarnation.&nbsp; The means to bring about
this union, was the removal of all the awful impediments which
were in the way, by the obedience, the sufferings, death, burial,
resurrection and ascension, intercession and life of Christ, as
Mediator in heaven for us.&nbsp; Nor can this blessed union be
felt or enjoyed by us, till God the Holy Ghost has subdued our
enmity, quickened our souls, reconciled us to God&rsquo;s mind,
shewed us the person, love, and work of Christ; made us willing
by his power, created holy desires in the soul, and enabled us to
say, Thou, Oh my God, in Christ art the thing that I long
for.&nbsp; Here is union felt; and as the soul is led on in the
knowledge of the great things of God, it is enabled to trace the
origin of this union to the counsels of eternity.&nbsp; I trust
you will, my dear brother, be enabled when you are called forth
to stand up as a spokesman for your dear Lord, declare what you
know of the counsel of God, not that you, or any other preacher,
either <i>know</i> or <i>can</i> declare the <i>whole</i> counsel
of God.&nbsp; Nothing is <a name="page138"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 138</span>more common than this expression,
and nothing can be more erroneous.&nbsp; I do not believe any one
ever declared the whole counsel of God, since our Lord and his
apostles on earth&mdash;<i>they</i> declared the whole, perfectly
and infallibly; but other ministers, however faithful they are,
must not say so, it is an error; but what the Lord has taught
you, that you can declare, even the truth as contained in the
grand doctrines of the Gospel; the perfections and glories of the
divide Jesus, the original ruin and present corruption and misery
of man, the spirituality of the holy law of God, the perfect
satisfaction of Christ, complete justification by his imputed
righteousness, regeneration by the operations of the eternal
spirit, spiritual faith and evangelical repentance towards God;
love <i>to</i>, arising <i>from</i> the knowledge <i>of</i> the
adorable Trinity in Unity, the warfare between the flesh and the
spirit, the trials of the way, the temptations of the adversary,
the strength, light, and comfort afforded us; the stability of
the eternal covenant, the depths of divine mercy, the perpetuity
of eternal love, with all the happy consequences of these truths
in the life, conduct, and the whole conversation.&nbsp; You and
I, my brother, are not afraid these great truths will make their
possessors careless of their conduct; No, every sin felt and
discovered, or the least outbreakings of it, is as a dagger to
the heart, a load upon the mind, nor can there be any rest till a
fresh manifestation of pardon is felt.&nbsp; We consider the work
of the ministry to be the greatest work and the highest honour
ever conferred on a poor fallen creature here.&nbsp; To make use
of the language of good old Mr. Ryland, here is full scope for
fear, hope, gratitude, justice, compassion, zeal, interest,
ambition, glory, pleasure, and unbounded fire; rise ambition, <a
name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>rise glory
into intense fire, and joy without bounds or end.&nbsp; Reflect,
O my soul, what astonishing glory for me to be decreed and
ordained by the great Head of the Church, to copy God&rsquo;s
eternal thoughts, to receive the infusions of ideas from all the
holy inspired penmen; to be called out of nothing, out of
meanness, obscurity, baseness, sin, and misery, to stand in the
place and room of the eternal Son of God, to paint his
perfections, to blaze abroad his glories about the world, to
display the virtue of his blood, and tell of his astonishing
death, the grandest action in the empire of God&mdash;to express
this action in a thousand points of light, to have the most
intimate treaties with immortal souls, to do nothing but transact
with souls&mdash;blood-bought souls; to be an ambassador, an
angel, a representative of the Son of God; to be put into his
place (in a certain sense) as a preacher, to have commerce with
deathless souls, to be inrolled by Christ in this time state
amongst the faithful and zealous preachers, and for Christ to
value us as dear and important to himself, and to the
church.&nbsp; This subject is so great, I scarcely know how to
write it, but so interesting, I must send you a line or two
more.&nbsp; What a glory to revive gospel doctrines, to display
Christ&rsquo;s glory, and to raise the credit of the work of the
Spirit; to die with the highest dignity, angels and good men
around my bed, and God himself within my soul.&nbsp; O what a
glory is this, to rise up amidst throngs of admiring smiling
angels, before the throne of the Son of God; to see all the great
and good preachers in heaven look at me as I rise, to hear them
say, Here, see, here he comes from his study, from his pulpit,
and from the bed of death to our shining worlds, and to his
Master&rsquo;s throne.&nbsp; See how Jesus looks at him, see how
he crowns him.&nbsp; Hark what he says to him, Well done good and
faithful servant, enter thou into the joy of thy <a
name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>Lord.&nbsp;
See him bring forth the crown of glory, and put it on my head,
for Christ will not trust the noblest angel in heaven to crown
his saints: he will do it himself, and will say, Here, ye
labourers, take your reward; ye shepherds, take your honour; ye
soldiers take your military glory; ye ambassadors, ye stewards,
ye angels of the churches, take your immortal crowns, live for
ever surrounded with sun beams, and crowned with stars.</p>
<p>May this felicity be yours and mine&mdash;&rsquo;tis well,
perhaps, the dignity, importance, responsibility, and trials of
the ministry, are hid from our eyes at the entrance on the work,
or I think none would go into it at all.&nbsp; What I have since
seen, had I seen it before, I do not think I should so willingly
have run, but would rather have been dragged.&nbsp; There is but
one thing would ever make me very willing to enter on the sacred
work, and it is <i>that</i>&mdash;and that love which makes me
willing to go forward again.&nbsp; Do you ask me what that
is?&nbsp; Why the same which made Isaiah willing to go, after he
had seen the glory of Christ God-Man, having finished
salvation&rsquo;s work, exalted, glorified, and adored, revealing
the word of pardon with power to his soul, and assuring him he
was pardoned; then he said, Here am I, send me &mdash;.&nbsp; See
6th chapter of Isaiah.&nbsp; I know the passage will bear a
higher comment, but I humbly conceive it represents
Isaiah&rsquo;s commission, and I can assure you, it is only such
feelings, views, and enjoyments, that make me willing now,
whatever were my motives before.&nbsp; I can appeal to the Lord,
as the searcher of all hearts, I want nothing now to do with the
ministry, but to proclaim all that I am led to understand by the
terms <i>God-Man Mediator</i>.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Ingle</span>.</p>
<p><span class="GutSmall">MY DEAR YOUNG FRIEND</span>,</p>
<p>I send you back the Diary of your late dear sister, which I
have perused with mingled emotions of joy and grief, of pleasure
and pain.&nbsp; Blessed be God for the grace given her in Christ
Jesus, before the world began, and manifested to her in so many
pleasing and painful ways.&nbsp; I wish I had money to spare to
send it into the world; but alas, I am straitened, yet I have
cause to be eternally thankful, and I beg the Lord will bring me
home to glory, to praise his dear name for it.&nbsp; My heart is
most sensibly affected with your dear mother&rsquo;s trials: what
a constant visitor affliction is at your house.&nbsp; How many
times hath death looked in, and took away those of your family
that were particularly dear to you all.&nbsp; Nor is he easy, he
is on the road again.&nbsp; The glorious conquerer of death, has
by his obedience and sufferings, his blood and death, converted
him into an angel of peace, a messenger of joy, sent to conduct
you to the upper and better house&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Far from a world of grief and sin,<br />
With God eternally shut in.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>The
pulling down the earthly house is all the misery, but it has got
the leprosy in the walls, and it must come down.&nbsp; Sin, that
tyrant and ugly monster, has rendered it necessary that it should
be changed, in order to enjoy union to the happy soul in another
state.&nbsp; The body has sinned with the soul, and it must
suffer with it, the body was redeemed with the soul, and it must
also be saved with it.&nbsp; But in order to enjoy that, it must
experience a change by sickness and death.&nbsp; This is a
painful subject, but the Lord will make it familiar to you.&nbsp;
I trust whenever death comes to you, he will wear an
angel&rsquo;s form, that he will be only your Lord&rsquo;s
porter, sent to open the gates of glory, and conduct you through
the consecrated way which our Lord has trod.&nbsp; As all things
are now dying with you, I humbly hope the Lord will most
graciously visit your soul with his love, shew you that your sins
are forgiven through the doing and dying of a precious
Saviour.&nbsp; He has blotted out, done away, hid, removed, and
covered all the sins of every coming sinner; and he says, Let him
return to the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and to our
God, and he will abundantly pardon; precious text.&nbsp;
Returning to the Lord, is the heart, mind, faith, and hope of a
soul, who was chosen in Christ, and united to Christ.&nbsp; Now,
by the power of the spirit bending, inclining, seeking, and
desiring Christ.&nbsp; Coming to the Lord our God is moving in
mind to the Father, as a God of love, grace, and mercy, in Christ
to us.&nbsp; Yet, if the Lord is drawing you to Christ, as your
only hope, mark, he will have mercy, he will abundantly
pardon.&nbsp; Are you, my dear girl, seeking his favour and mercy
to be manifested to your soul, convinced of your need of it? is
your heart set upon it? do you believe that you shall be lost
without it? and has God the ever <a name="page143"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 143</span>blessed Spirit shewn you that Christ
is a suitable Saviour, and that he is the gift of the
Father&rsquo;s love to guilty man?&nbsp; And do you choose him as
your Saviour and only hope, your atoning sacrifice, and your only
righteousness?&nbsp; God be praised, you have ever heard the
gospel, which has pointed you to him, though you know it is not
enough to be pointed to Christ, but we want bringing to
him.&nbsp; Hence the promise, They shall come, and I will lead
them.</p>
<p>Let me conclude this short letter by reciting a few texts, to
encourage you in seeking the Lord.&nbsp; If thou seek him, he
will be found of thee.&nbsp; If thou seek the Lord thy God, thou
shalt find him if thou seek him with all thy heart, and with all
thy soul.&nbsp; Thou Lord hast not forsaken them that seek
thee.&nbsp; Your heart shall live that seek God.&nbsp; I said not
unto the seed of Jacob, seek me in vain.&nbsp; Ye shall seek me,

ye the Lord, till he come and rain righteousness upon you.&nbsp;

diligently seek him.&nbsp; The hand of our God is upon all them
that seek him for good.</p>

<p style="text-align: right"><i>Valley of Achor</i>, <i>April</i>
12, 1819.</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edmunds</span>.</p>
<p><span class="GutSmall">MY DEAR FRIEND</span>,</p>
<p>It is many months ago since I saw you, but I hope you are
still in the ways of God, looking unto Jesus.&nbsp; You and I
have been taught to see there is nothing but misery and
destruction out of Christ, nor any hope but in his word and
work.&nbsp; The Lord has opened to us the spirituality of his
law, and often reflected an humbling sense of his displeasure on
the mind.&nbsp; Sin has been felt, and guilt has laid us
low&mdash;fear, dread, and darkness has been on the soul, and
bondage, enmity, rebellion, and distance, has been most sensibly
experienced.&nbsp; These things have frequently beset me since I
have been here, and although they have been painful feelings, I
esteem them after they are over, as to the hungry soul, every
bitter thing is sweet.&nbsp; But the Father not only chastens us,
but he draws us to Christ.&nbsp; He first teaches us our lost
state.&nbsp; I do not say the Lord communicates this bondage,
this darkness and misery, but we are quickened to feel our
sinfulness, and all these unpleasant sensations come on, of
course; but being thus chastened, we are taught the value of
Christ, by seeing our need of a Mediator, a surety, a better
righteousness, and an intercessor in the light of the <a
name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>word; and
by the spirit we see the exact suitableness of Christ, and are
quickened to long for a sense of his mercy, the pardon of sin,
and peace with God, in God&rsquo;s own way.&nbsp; This we desire
above all things else; and the adorable Father draws us out in
holy, humble desires, fervent breathings, and earnest entreaties
for the joys of pardoning love, and a gracious visit from
Christ.&nbsp; The Father kindly guides our eyes to the promises,
the invitations, the precious declarations, and kind words of the
Saviour in the Gospel.&nbsp; These draw the heart; and as faith
gathers sweet views, so hope springs up, and the fears of death
and hell, with a sense of God&rsquo;s anger, gradually
abate.&nbsp; The Holy Spirit testifies of Jesus in the word, and
in our hearts; gives us blessed views of his person and love, his
infinite condescension, and his most blessed work in putting away
sin, and fulfilling the law; conquering death and subduing hell;
and as living a life of mediation in heaven for us.&nbsp; These
things become precious, as the mind is opened to receive these
truths; and as power is felt, so the fruits appear.&nbsp; His
love is seen, and this sight under the spirit&rsquo;s power melts
us into nothing, produces godly sorrow, sweet repentance and
humility, self loathing, and glowing love to God.&nbsp;
<i>This</i>, <i>this</i> my dear friend is my past, and often is
my present experience, and my conscience can witness to it; and
as to the bad opinion which good men have of me, it once
distressed me; but since I have found the good opinion of crowds
has been a snare to my soul, has puffed me up with pride, and set
me down in carnal ease, I am best without it.&nbsp; Applause does
not agree with my spiritual constitution, I grow best in the
valley.&nbsp; Can the flag or the rush grow without the
mire?&nbsp; I wish I had never courted the applause of man, but
had been a little more anxious for the approbation <a
name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>of God and
my conscience.&nbsp; A good name was an idol, and the Devil has
run away with mine; no doubt in many cases I have justly deserved
it, and now it is my duty, privilege and mercy, to learn what God
means by this trial.&nbsp; Hence the command, Hear ye the rod,
and who hath appointed it; and the men of wisdom shall see thy
name.&nbsp; I have taken the highest seat in God&rsquo;s house,
but the dung hill and the lowest form in the school suits me
now.&nbsp; I have been building my nest in the tree of creature
friendship, but this storm has blown it down, and now I am glad
to embrace the rock I wet with the showers from the mountains of
trouble; but I find shelter, hope, and solid rest in Jesus and
his finished work.&nbsp; I shall be more fit to preach when I
return, than I was before; but I will never preach again, till
the Lord evidently calls me out.&nbsp; I ran once, but I ran too
fast, and fell into trouble.&nbsp; When God lifts me up again, I
shall stand more surely and safely, because I hope to stand in
the Son, to abide in the vine, to continue in the truth, to keep
in the love of God, and all that these expressions imply.</p>
<p>I trust you and your&rsquo;s are growing in grace, that you
still find the Saviour precious, your helper and deliverer.&nbsp;
The Lord is with me, and I know it, and the good of it will be
seen after many days.&nbsp; Kind respects to those who still
secretly esteem me for my master&rsquo;s sake.</p>

<p style="text-align: right"><i>Valley of Achor</i>, <i>June</i>

<p>Dear Miss <span class="smcap">Smith</span>,</p>
<p>The little Poem on Friendship which I read to you, and you was
so kind as to compliment, will be published shortly, separate
from this little work.&nbsp; It is a good remark I have somewhere
met with, that Friendship is a plant of too delicate a nature to
grow, with any great degree of luxuriancy and fruitfulness, in
the soil of the human heart; but I ever wish to prize its buds,
its blossoms, its fruits, its very leaves, and above all, its
Divine Root; and I have a hope founded upon the doing and dying
of the adorable Friend of guilty man, that I shall enjoy this
best of gifts in its eternal bloom, in a brighter better world,
when the winds of scandal shall howl no more; the tumultuous
waves and the roaring billows of complicated grief shall distress
my already tempest-tossed mind no more for ever.&nbsp; I have
found many acquaintance who hummed about me in the warmth of
prosperity, but like summer insects, those butterflies
disappeared, when the cold blasts of adversity, by reproach,
struck a few of my outward enjoyments; but I am more divinely led
to the enjoyment of that love which can never alter or
decay.&nbsp; I have learned wisdom now, in some measure, to
discriminate between friends and acquaintance; and although the
latter have started back in the day of battle, yet the former
still bear me on their hearts in the right place, <a
name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>and
<i>here</i> they present me, that my trials may be sanctified to
me, and to the Church at large.&nbsp; David had many
acquaintances, but did not find a <i>Jonathan</i> every
day.&nbsp; In the Church, or in the world, my trials are great;
but these would not have been so (speaking after the manner of
men) if all my acquaintance had been real friends.</p>
<p>I beg to conclude this note with a few jingling verses, with
my most affectionate and grateful respects to your dear father
and mother, and hope ever to bear in mind their unwearied
kindness.</p>
<blockquote><p>Had all mine acquaintance been friends,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At whose urgent request I have run,<br />
To answer some frivolous end,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And injure me when I had done&mdash;</p>
<p>Had all mine acquaintance been friends,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My case before God they would lay,<br />
And, knowing his will in his word,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Have helpt me to watch and to pray.</p>
<p>Had all mine acquaintance been friends,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They ne&rsquo;er would have robb&rsquo;d me of
peace,<br />
But comforted, cheer&rsquo;d, and upheld,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And wish&rsquo;d me an increase of grace.</p>
<p>Had all mine acquaintance been friends,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They ne&rsquo;er would have wounded my name,<br />
But covered my errors in love,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And reproved when I was to blame.</p>
<p>Had all my acquaintance been friends,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They&rsquo;d ne&rsquo;er have rejoic&rsquo;d in my
fall,<br />
But pitied, and prayed, and upheld,<br />

<p style="text-align: right"><i>Valley of Achor</i>,
<i>February</i> 2<i>nd</i>. 1818.</p>
<p>Mr. &amp; Mrs. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>.</p>
<p><span class="GutSmall">MY VERY DEAR, FAITHFUL, and TRIED
FRIENDS</span>,</p>
<p>Grace and peace be to you both.&nbsp; I would have wrote
before now, but not knowing your direction, I waited till I had
the pleasure of hearing of you, which I did this day, from my
much esteemed Friend Mrs. Brown.&nbsp; I have no news to relate,
I only write to assure you the Lord is very gracious to me; and
by his word, and by his spirit, he bears up my sinking mind like
pillars of marble.&nbsp; I am a monument of mercy indeed, and so
you would say, if you knew my broken heart and afflicted
mind.&nbsp; I am at times brought very low, but then I get lifted
up from the dunghill, and my spirit rejoices in God my
Saviour.&nbsp; I trust you will not be moved by the things which
have happened to me.&nbsp; There is now and ever will in this
world be a peculiar <a name="page150"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 150</span>mystery in divine providence; but
God is his own interpreter&mdash;the dear Saviour is the great
Head of the Church, and as he loves us, desires our company, and
wants to give some particular expression of his love; so he
brings low, empties us, chastens, tries, and alarms us.&nbsp; The
cup of salvation being allotted us, we must meet with alarming
providences, which are not explained to us, till he reveals
himself, as our brother, gives us a double mess, and an exchange
of raiment.&nbsp; The things that have befallen me, I trust are
in covenant love; the Lord is only putting on his yoke, and
opening a way to manifest his grace the clearer, and to prove the
riches of his mercy.&nbsp; O that we may yet praise him who is
our helper, and in due time will be our deliverer.&nbsp; My sun
is gone ten degrees back, like Hezekiah&rsquo;s, but the Lord
will bring it up.&nbsp; My master has given orders, and I, for
shame, have taken the lowest seat.&nbsp; I feel convictions of
sin sharper, but I find Christ more than ever blessed.&nbsp; O
could every brick and book in my room speak, they would tell what
passes between God and my soul.&nbsp; I am grieved to be here, on
account of my friends, my family, and the cause of God, and my
poor heart is at times completely melted.&nbsp; I am in real
sorrow, yet I have now, and shall ever have cause to bless God
for what I am learning in this painful school.</p>
<p>I would now ask how is my dear afflicted companion in
tribulation Mr. M.&nbsp; I trust our dear Lord has appeared for
him in his kind providence, and that the Saviour is precious to
his soul; I am begging the Lord to teach me how to live a life of
faith on the Son of God.&nbsp; Christ himself, when here below,
lived and died in faith, and the Apostle said, He lived on Christ
as crucified, <a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
151</span>as his righteousness, his intercessor, his head and
representative.&nbsp; This is the life I want to live; but then I
find there is no life but as it is given me daily, nor can I
exercise this life of faith, but as power is given from
above.&nbsp; We live by virtue of being quickened by the spirit,
though we often get dead, dark, cold, carnal, and lifeless, so
that we can hardly call it a life.&nbsp; But the Apostle says,
Not I, but Christ liveth in me.&nbsp; I want my dear Mrs. M. to
notice this expression.&nbsp; I hope, as a Child of God, and as
deeply tried, I am alive in your mind, I <i>exist</i>, I
<i>live</i> in your mind&mdash;you often think of me, but you
cannot do for me what you would: I take the will for the
deed.&nbsp; Now, as we see what it is for a friend to live in us,
the subject is clear to you: Christ has an existence in your
mind, as you have heard of him; this is the difference between a
worldling and a believer; the former hears of Christ, that is
enough for him; the other not only <i>hears</i>, but Christ has a
<i>place</i> in the mind, as he is set forth in the word: the
will makes choice of him, the affections are fixed on him, faith
trusts in him, hope expects him, patience waits for him, love
enjoys him, and, as our views enlarge, and power is given to see
him taking away sin, conscience enjoys peace with God, because it
is given to faith to see God is everlastingly at peace with
us.&nbsp; Well may the Apostle say, Lord increase our faith; this
is what I want, and I hope my much-loved friends are favoured
with it.&nbsp; I am at present in the furnace but the Lord
regulates the heat, and I am at times so happy I really dont want
to come out of it; but sometimes it is so hot, all the dross and
tin of my rebellion boils up, and I am astonished the Lord ever
lets me live at all.&nbsp; I wonder at his patience and
forbearance, and when I taste his mercy and love, my affections
are led out to <a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
152</span>him again, and I long to get to glory to praise him as
I desire to do.&nbsp; I have much to be thankful for; my wants
are supplied, and the Lord is with me, so that it is better with
me now than the last two years of my liberty; the Lord has both
pardoned and subdued my sins, and he is leading me on in the
divine life&mdash;only the weather is cold, nights are long, my
company is bad, and I have hardly time or place for reading or
writing, except what I get by stealth.&nbsp; How long this trial
will last, I know not, I long for it to be over, but I fear I
shall loose my sweet seasons.&nbsp; My heart is overcome with
grief, when I think of the poor <i>Packet Distress</i>: she is
out at sea, in the dark and in the deep.&nbsp; I want my heart
fixed at all times, trusting in the Lord; I know it will be well
with them that fear the Lord, and I have reason to believe the
Lord has blessed me with that grace, and keeps me in it, but we
find that more sensibly at one time than another, so David found
it; how he feared the Lord when his conscience checked him for
cutting off the lappet of Saul&rsquo;s coat, but where was his
fear of God in the Matter of Uriah?&nbsp; We want our weak graces
kept alive, maintained, and exercised on their proper object;
they must be tried, and as God tries our graces, so he gives us
an opportunity of trying him, and as we have found him faithful
in times past, so we shall again, to his own honour.&nbsp; He
knoweth the path I take, and when he hath tried me, I shall come
forth as gold&mdash;Christ is the gold, and we are said to be
predestinated to be conformed to his image, both in spirit,
trials, and glory.&nbsp; The Apostle has set before us a noble
army of cross-bearers, and after he had advised the Church to
notice those stars in the 11th of Hebrews, he recommends a
perpetual looking at the Son, who for the joy that was set before
him, endured the cross; <a name="page153"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 153</span>and a cross is allotted for all the
saints, either in soul, body, circumstances, family, from Satan
or some sin, from saint or from sinner.&nbsp; This has been the
Lot of God&rsquo;s family, and you cannot say that you have been
exempt&mdash;many, and deep have been your trials, but you are
still the living, the living to praise him.&nbsp; God be with
you.</p>

<p><span class="GutSmall">MY VERY DEAR FRIEND</span>,</p>
<p>I trust you are well in health, with your family; it is just a
year ago since I last wrote to you, which letter being wrote
under very peculiar circumstances, and under the powerful
influence of grace which I felt at that time, which letter I have
in reserve to be published at a future period, when the Lord
turns my captivity.&nbsp; Many, and great have been your changes
and trials since that time; we live in a world of changes and
vicissitudes, it may justly be compared to the sea, ever restless
and uneasy, exposed to many storms and dangers, but the Lord has
engaged to conduct us safe home, and will surely bring us to that
haven of eternal rest and peace; and as this is the case, we need
not murmur, although our <i>Ferry Boat</i> is a little tossed
about, and some of the passengers prove very troublesome, we
shall soon get home, eternal love has sworn <a
name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>to bring us
safely there; and though the mountains depart, and the hills be
removed, yet his kindness shall never depart from us, nor the
covenant of his peace ever be removed.&nbsp; The Lord foresaw
what poor sinners we should be, and he could have prevented it,
had it been agreeable to his eternal purposes; but if it had been
prevented, what should we have known of the boundless mercy of
his heart, and how could we have known any thing of the lovely
precious Saviour and Redeemer.&nbsp; God had decreed that the
vessels of his glory should be vessels of his mercy first, and
all he has purposed, promised, and done, is for the riches of his
grace, in kindness towards us, by Christ Jesus; and this free
unmerited favor of a covenant God, has brought salvation of every
kind to us: we have experienced some of them, and there are
thousands of salvations which we are not sensible of, that attend
us daily.&nbsp; I trust the Lord is leading you on to a better
acquaintance with the person and work of Jesus, and though you
lament that you do not feel so much love to him, as you did in
your earlier experience, yet you are learning
wisdom&mdash;&ldquo;Whom shall he teach wisdom, and whom shall he
make to understand doctrine, but those who are weaned from the
breast, and drawn from the milk.&rdquo;&nbsp; Isaiah xxviii,
9.&nbsp; After this weaning time is over, we feel our need of
spiritual armour, and we are called out to fight; but never let
us forget him who hath said, My grace is sufficient for thee.</p>
<p>I beg you to accept my best wishes, in the language of a
favorite, now in glory.</p>
<blockquote><p>I wish you much increase of every grace,<br />
I wish you strength to run your christian race,<br />
<a name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>I wish
you patience under every rod,<br />
I wish you much sweet fellowship with God,<br />
I wish your evidences bright may shine,<br />
I wish you joy and comfort all divine,<br />

I wish you well through life, and well in death,<br />
I wish you safe on the celestial shore,<br />

<i>June</i> 1st 1819.</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sweetland</span>.</p>
<p><span class="GutSmall">MY DEAR KIND FRIEND</span>,</p>
<p>I hope the Lord Jesus is precious to your soul, that your
heart is fixed on him, and that you are daily looking to him for
life and salvation.&nbsp; I hope every fresh feeling sense of
sin, urges you to his blood and righteousness, as the only
remedy, as the serpent-bit-Israelites of old were to look to the
brazen serpent: all were to look at it; some looked stedfastly,
others feebly, some had a full, near, distinct view of it, but
others only had a feeble, distant, imperfect, confused sight, and
many, perhaps, could hardly raise their dying eyes to catch a
glimpse of it; yet, they all looked, at some rate or other, and
all who looked, lived, and were <a name="page156"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 156</span>healed.&nbsp; This points out the
various states of God&rsquo;s dear people, in the strength and
weakness of their faith, as exercised on the dear Saviour; and as
it shews the diversity of their cases, so it also points out the
various frames of mind an individual soul may experience.&nbsp;
There are times when we are strong in faith, persuaded the work
is begun, and we can look to the Lord with stedfast eye; but
there are other seasons when faith seems to languish, love to be
dead, and hope seems to have perished, the world and its cares
have carried the mind away, and Satan has confused and perplexed
us.&nbsp; Nothing seems left in the soul, but perhaps a little
desire, and that hardly awake or felt.&nbsp; Here we stumble,
till the work is again revived, and the dew descends again.&nbsp;
This made the prophet of old exclaim, Wilt thou not revive us
again, and, Oh Lord, revive thy work in the midst of the
years.&nbsp; And when the Saviour draws near, we are grieved that
we should slight him so ungratefully, and as love flows in, godly
sorrow flows out.&nbsp; To this repentance we are called by the
Spirit, and it is a change of the mind; this change is
God&rsquo;s work on us: we cannot produce it, and yet it so
important, that we cannot be saved without it, it must be wrought
in us by the power of God.&nbsp; Christ is exalted to give it in
<i>his</i> most blessed characters, as a Prince and a Saviour:
this is a dissolving the heart, or rather the new heart in
exercise, under the gracious operations of the Holy Spirit; the
mind is overcome with a sense of the long suffering of God
towards us, and a feeling discovery of his love to us, in Christ
Jesus, with a view of our own depravity, and base backslidings;
we mourn that we ever offended such a Saviour, or sinned against
such love; we are ashamed of ourselves, especially when we see
our God sweetly pacified, and his heart <a
name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>full of
love towards us.&nbsp; This was the holy generous feeling of Mary
Magdalen, and this work must be felt in some humble degree, if
ever we are saved, for except we repent, we must perish in our
sins, because this repentance is the effect&mdash;not the cause
of pardon, nor is it produced from any fear or dread of hell, but
from a sense of love, because we have had the baseness and
ingratitude, the cruelty and the bitterness to sin against a
good, a gracious, a kind, and a bountiful God: we loath ourselves
in our own sight for our abominations, and as this is the fruit
of the Spirit, so it is pleasant and acceptable to God.&nbsp; I
hope my dear friend will be favored with this blessing, it is an
evidence of pardon, pardon is an evidence of redemption, and that
is the gift of God; and this gift is an evidence of eternal
love.</p>
<p>I trust you are in health, no doubt you feel your mortality,
by many attacks of pain of body.&nbsp; We are poor dying mortals,
the creatures of a day; we do all fade as a leaf, <i>not</i> as a
tree, but as a weak, helpless, trembling leaf, but precious faith
in our Lord, and his love, his sacred name, and his complete
work&mdash;this assures us we have a building of God, eternal in
the heavens, and that building is Christ</p>
<blockquote><p>Yet a season, and you know<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Happy entrance shall be given,<br />
All our sorrows left below,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And earth exchang&rsquo;d for heaven.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Farq</span>.</p>
<p><span class="GutSmall">MY DEAR BROTHER</span>,</p>
<p>I trust the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ will reign
triumphant in your soul, till it is consummated in endless
bliss.&nbsp; Various are the fears, doubts, and misgivings of
heart, to which you have been liable; many have been the Workings
of inbred corruption, and the power of sin, as stirred up by the
law, and which lay hid, till they were seen and felt by you; this
being attended with gloominess, dejection, and legal striving,
shews that it was the work of the law; and the Lord taking the
opportunity to lead you to Jesus, as the atoning sacrifice, and
the end of the law for righteousness, shews the greatness of his
rich grace, and the boundless love of his heart.&nbsp; But God
and your own soul best knows, what distress of mind is
experienced before the Saviour speaks peace to the heart, and
assures it of its acceptance and justification before God, in
<i>his</i> own work: yet, amidst all the distress, a truly
awakened grace-taught soul experiences, there is a clearing
<i>to</i>, and a humble trusting <i>in</i> Christ, so that if you
had died in that distress of mind, you would most certainly have
been saved, seeing our interest in Christ does not save the soul,
it was saved in the Lord long before we had an existence; but no
humbled believer can rest short of the knowledge and personal
enjoyment of that salvation, by the leadings and teachings of the
<a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>Holy
Spirit, as the glorifier of Christ.&nbsp; I remember this was my
case, and I find it has been yours&rsquo;: this is the secret
path which no fowl knoweth, and the vulture&rsquo;s eye hath not
yet seen: all spiritual teaching is the evidence of our interest
in the electing love of God, all others are passed by.&nbsp; I do
not wonder at your esteem for that sweet chapter, the 50th of
Isaiah, it would fill an immense volume to do it justice, in
describing its full glories; the Holy Spirit led the mind of the
prophet very divinely into the knowledge of Christ, as the
atonement and justification of his people; and this subject is
most sweetly set forth in this chapter, with an affectionate
address to poor souls walking in darkness, about their interest
in Christ, and a direction given them how to act in such a
state.&nbsp; The chapter opens with the reason why the Lord had
rejected the Jews, and why <i>he</i> put them away, viz. for
their awful and obstinate rejection of the person, the ministry,
the miracles, and work of the Son of God.&nbsp; The adorable
Redeemer then asserts the dignity of his own God-head, as
manifested in the awful and grand display of his works of power,
justice, and vengeance; these great themes are set forth in the
three first verses.&nbsp; The Saviour then describes his
commission from the Father, to accomplish the calling and
redemption of the elect, agreeable to an ancient stipulation, or
covenant, subsisting between the father and the Son; <i>he</i>
next points out <i>his</i> ability for the work as God-Man, and
<i>his</i> qualifications, by the out-pouring of the Holy Spirit
without measure upon <i>him</i>, in the 4th and 5th
verse&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Next follows his voluntary abasement of
himself into the hands of <i>his</i> enemies, with the firmness
of his mind, and the constancy of his love to his church, as
manifested in his unparalleled sorrows, his confidence in his
being carried <a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
160</span>through the great and arduous work of the redemption of
his church, and his full triumph over all his enemies; the help
that was promised him by his Father, in the covenant, and the
challenge that he would give to the enemies of his dear people,
for whom he should work out a complete righteousness; read the 6,
7, 8, and 9th verses.&nbsp; Christ Jesus did in the love of his
heart engage, agreeable to the call of the Father, to become the
surety of his Church: all their sins being imputed to him, he
stood guilty in the eye of the law, and justice of God; and
having given ample satisfaction to justice, fulfilled the law,
made reconciliation, glorified all the perfections of God, and
put away sin: he was justified in the Spirit at his resurrection,
having paid the debt, he received the receipt in full, and upon
his triumphant entrance into glory, bearing the marks and scars
in his sacred body, with the virtue of his work fresh in the mind
of God, and sweetly accepted by him, he gives the challenge to
law, to justice, to all.&nbsp; Who shall lay any thing to the
charge of God&rsquo;s elect, unpardoned, unatoned for?&nbsp; Who
will contend with me? let us stand together: Who is mine
adversary? let him come near to me!&nbsp; This is Christ&rsquo;s
universal challenge to all accusers of his children: he has done
the work, nothing can be added to it, or taken from it, and the
adorable Father imputes this work to his Church; faith is given
them to receive this atonement and righteousness, and power is
given them to enjoy it as their own; and this believing and
receiving the work the Lord Jesus has accomplished, is called,
obeying Christ&rsquo;s voice; while the work of God on the heart
is stiled, fearing the Lord.&nbsp; This fear, and this obedience
are evidences of interest in the great work of the Triumphant
Conquerer of sin, death, and hell.&nbsp; And, whoever among the
Lord&rsquo;s <a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
161</span>called ones, are walking without a sense of God&rsquo;s
love, find a sense of interest in the Redeemer; without the light
of comfort, the light of joy, and the light of love; though
darkness is felt by them, and nothing but darkness without them,
yet they are not totally in the dark, but they are the children
of the light, and of the day.&nbsp; Let such trust in Jesus, and
stay their minds upon the Spirit&rsquo;s testimony of Christ; but
this trusting and staying is the gift of God.&nbsp; The chapter
then concludes with an address to all pharisees, who reject the
perfect work of Christ, and who trust in a form of godliness,
without the power.&nbsp; Such compass themselves about with their
own sparks, walk in their own light, and die, at last, in
sorrow.&nbsp; The parable of the foolish virgins will illustrate
this last verse.</p>

respects to your better half.</p>

14<i>th</i>, 1818.</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Freeman</span>.</p>
<p><span class="GutSmall">MY DEAR FRIEND</span>,</p>
<p>Grace be with you.&nbsp; The hand of our Father has separated
us for a time; this is done in infinite wisdom, and I hope in
covenant love.&nbsp; I do not pretend to say my case is similar
to the holy apostle Paul&rsquo;s, but I trust there is the same
grand end to be answered, by my <a name="page162"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 162</span>captivity.&nbsp; Several, I hope,
will have to bless God that I was ever brought into this place:
some poor run-away servant, like Onesimus&mdash;some prodigal
character, and strange to tell, some proud and self-conceited
pharisee, I hope, has learnt a little by my feeble efforts in
this place&mdash;the only way to God.&nbsp; I have great hopes of
an awful character also&mdash;nor have I any great desire to
leave this captivity, till I see <i>what</i> the Lord is about to
do with him.&nbsp; I see much wisdom in my removal from the
Church for a time: many grew tired of the repeated messages of
mercy which I constantly delivered, and would travel all day long
in search of some other preachers: this was not acting like
contented children.&nbsp; And I know also, that the Lord would
remove me away for a time, because those Israelites began to
loathe the manna; for this purpose fiery serpents were sent in
among them.&nbsp; Christ calls some people serpents, and their
lying tongues are compared to fire.&nbsp; These have stung the
people, but let us look to him who is lifted upon the pole of the
Gospel, and who alone can cure our wounds, and heal all our
diseases.&nbsp; I am much pleased in hopes of seeing this sweet
text yet accomplished, (30th Isaiah) &ldquo;Moreover the light of
the moon, shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the
sun shall be seven-fold, as the light of seven days, when the
Lord bindeth up the breach of his people, and healeth the stroke
of their wind&rdquo;&mdash;Selah.&nbsp; But my dear Friend, I
also am highly culpable; persecution having ceased, and
prosperity come on, faith could not grow in this state.&nbsp; I
mixed too much with the world, and grew too careless of
God&rsquo;s tried ones&mdash;the rod was wanted, had it been
spared, I should have been spoilt, but my heavenly Father would
not spare for my much crying; it is now my duty, and mercy to
detain <a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
163</span>this messenger, and read what the Lord means by it,
knowing the master&rsquo;s feet is behind, I hope, with many a
blessing for us all.&nbsp; It is in this confidence I hope yet to
praise Him, who now supports, consoles, upholds, and often smiles
on my soul.&nbsp; In his presence is life&mdash;My presence shall
go with thee.&nbsp; Whither shall I flee from thy presence?&nbsp;
Is not this presence the Holy Spirit himself, who is promised to
the Church?&nbsp; And is not Christ himself the very life of the
soul?&nbsp; Is he not the very life of heaven above, and the life
of the Church?&nbsp; Do you not see and feel a deadness in a
congregation, and under a sermon, if your Lord is not all in
all?&nbsp; Is not every place without him, like the empty grave
of Christ?&nbsp; They may be good moral men, both the minister
and the people; such angels may be sitting at the head and feet
of that Church, but no spiritual Mary can be happy, if the Master
is not there.&nbsp; The grave cloaths may be well folded up, and
the napkin that was about the head, in a place by itself; these
things our dear Lord left behind him, and if the veil is taken
from our eyes, if our bonds are loosed, we must leave those
things which bound us by nature.&nbsp; Legal ceremonies and
pharisaic works&mdash;these must be left in Christ&rsquo;s grave,
we have nothing to do with them; if we be risen with Christ, we
must seek those things which are above.&nbsp; I trust you are
quickened by his power, that the Holy Spirit is leading you to
Christ, as the resurrection and the very life of your soul: that
you feel <i>after</i> him, when he is distant, feel <i>for</i>
him in his sorrows, and feel miserable when you are not allowed
to draw near.&nbsp; Is this your experience? blessed be God if it
is.&nbsp; Do observe&mdash;when all is dark within then it is
your time to go out to Christ: only read the 3rd. and the former
part of the 5th chapter of Solomon&rsquo;s <a
name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>Song, and
if light is given you on these chapters, it will cast a radiancy
on the way the Lord has led you.&nbsp; Still beg of God that my
trials may be of use to me, and to many&mdash;time is on the
wing, and if prayer did not succeed in keeping me from this
place, nor yet in my speedy deliverance, yet, I have blessings in
abundance, and this trial will turn out for the furtherance of
the truth, through your prayers.</p>
<p>I hope the pious friendly Females I had the pleasure of seeing
with you, are all well: give them my kind love, tell them it will
be well.&nbsp; Wishing you every covenant blessing in enjoyment,
especially that in the 8th chapter of Hebrews&mdash;10, 11, and
12th verses,</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Watts</span>.</p>
<p><span class="GutSmall">MY EVER DEAR FRIEND</span>,</p>
<p>Grace and peace be with you.&nbsp; I received and read your
simple, but sincere testimony of the work of God on your soul,
with pleasure&mdash;Oh! that the ever adorable Spirit would
increase it, that you may abound in knowledge and
judgement.&nbsp; It is a mercy to be called by grace in our early
days.&nbsp; What shall we render to the Lord, for thinking upon
us in our low estate; for bestowing a thought of us in the
councils <a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
165</span>of eternity, and appointing us to obtain salvation, by
the doing and dying of a glorious Redeemer?&nbsp; We are poor,
lost, vile, guilty creatures, in and of ourselves: we are ten
thousand times more vile and sinful than we can possibly
conceive; there is not an evil done under the sun, but we have
got the root of it in our hearts.&nbsp; This I have often
declared, but I am now more sensibly led to know it; the Lord is
gradually teaching me in deep experience, what I have often
preached to others.&nbsp; I have many sad moments, but the
Saviour smiles again, and then I get up and run on a little
while; but, alas! the burden of a body of sin and death, sinks my
spirits again, and sometimes I have darkness on my path; but I
must tell you, that when I am drove out from every joy, hope,
comfort, or pleasure, I always find it most blessed to cast
myself at the dear Saviour&rsquo;s feet, saying</p>
<blockquote><p>Lord thine arm must be reveal&rsquo;d<br />
Ere I can by faith be heal&rsquo;d,<br />
Since I scarce can look to thee,<br />
Cast a gracious look on me,<br />
At thy feet I humbly lay,<br />
Shine, Oh! shine my fears away.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What a special favour, my dear friend, to be led to the
Saviour, to know him in any measure, by the teachings of his own
Spirit; to desire him above all, and to make up all our happiness
alone in him.&nbsp; When you look around you on those who are
destitute of grace, and whose souls abhor the very sound of
religion, and others who are contented with a bare outside shew;
these have a form and a name to live, but they are dead, and why
do we differ from them&mdash;this is an act of pure mercy and
covenant love.&nbsp; We do not envy their state, although they
possess every comfort in life, nor does <a
name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>Satan
trouble them; but we are chastened and judged of the Lord that we
should not be condemned with the world.&nbsp; We are brought into
judgement in our own hearts, God the Spirit illuminates and
quickens the conscience, we feel our guilt, we acknowledge the
justice of our sentence, and see that God would be just if he cut
us off, and sent us to hell.&nbsp; We are filled with fears, we
are distrest in mind, nor can any solid comfort be felt, only as
God is pleased to give us scriptural views of Christ&mdash;as the
gift of the Father&rsquo;s love, as every way suited to act for
us with God, as our Mediator, being God with God, and man with
man, well calculated to make an atonement, to bring God and man
together, into a state of reconciliation; to obey the law which
we had violated, and to endure that very curse which we had
deserved&mdash;blessing on his dear name, he felt all the hell in
his precious soul and sacred body, which we had deserved, and he
left nothing for us to do, but to believe and to take the comfort
of it.&nbsp; And here it is we want much light, life, and power;
that we may be able to receive this great work in such a way, as
to produce peace, love, and joy.&nbsp; We want the heart
persuaded into this truth; hence the Saviour said, Receive the
truth, and the truth shall make you free.&nbsp; And these are
some of the many precious truths we want power to receive&mdash;I
have blotted out as a thick cloud thy transgressions.&nbsp; In
the Lord shall thou be justified, and shall glory.&nbsp; Yea, I
have loved thee with an everlasting love.&nbsp; Having begun the
good work, he will finish it.&nbsp; I will never leave thee nor
forsake thee.</p>
<p>The Lord give my much loved friend power to take, receive, and
enjoy these precious truths in her own <a
name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>soul.&nbsp;
I am much melted into wonder, and gratitude, and praise, when I
hear the Lord has ever blessed my poor message to any of his dear
people, that he ever gave testimony to the word of his grace, by
my feeble instrumentality&mdash;glory be to his name, he has made
me manifest to your soul that he sent me to preach; and having
experienced his love, you are enabled to prove it, by
sympathising with me in my sorrows, and helping to comfort me in
tribulation.&nbsp; May the dear Lord bring me back in the fulness
of the blessings of the gospel of Christ, truly humbled in
spirit, and with a heart and a mouth full of Christ, that I may
yet praise him who is the health of my countenance, and my
merciful God.</p>

dependence, and God be glorified in your present and your eternal

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frimbley</span>.</p>
<p><span class="GutSmall">MY DEAR SIR</span>,</p>
<p>Not having seen or heard of my dear friend for some time past,
I must inquire after you, hoping that I need make no apology for
the friendly enquiry.&nbsp; I suppose you are still in the
wilderness, and God has <a name="page168"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 168</span>promised to make this world such to
us&mdash;he has not given such a promise to the non-elect; it is
their paradise, and our plague; &rsquo;tis their home, but our
inn; &rsquo;tis their portion, but our bait.&nbsp; We are not
born for this place, it is doomed to fire; we are but pilgrims,
staying at this spot, till an order comes from the king of the
better country, and demands us home.&nbsp; And is heaven our
home&mdash;are we sure that we shall get safe at last? let us
examine, for faith can reason well.&nbsp; If the Lord meant to
destroy us, he would not have shewed us what he has, nor would he
have told us what he has: we have seen our natures, found them
vile; we have seen the spirituality of God&rsquo;s law, we have
seen the vanity of all things below the stars, we have seen our
strength to be perfect weakness, we have seen the exact
suitableness of Christ, we have seen the value of his blood and
obedience, and the love of his heart in bearing our persons
before the throne, we have seen his good hand in many a trouble,
and we have seen his faithfulness, mercy, wisdom, and
truth.&nbsp; We have seen many and better people than we are,
blaze in a profession, and go out in darkness; we have seen the
workings of corruption, and the malice of Satan.&nbsp; Can my
dear friend deny it?&nbsp; Are not these truths in your
soul&rsquo;s experience and mine?&nbsp; Many a grand doctrine has
the blessed Spirit opened to us, many a promise has he applied,
many a sweet thought has he sent home, many a precious idea has
he formed in the mind, and many a gracious hint of his greatness,
goodness, and love: these are some things he has told
us&mdash;the secret of the Lord, is with them that fear him, and
he will shew them his covenant.&nbsp; I trust the Lord is
carrying you on in the divine life; he has promised that the path
of his people, shall be as the light of the day&mdash;that day
may <a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>be
cloudy, windy, and stormy, yet it is day, because the darkness of
nature is past, and shall never return, Mysterious providences
may distress, yea almost distract us, yet faith will ride again,
she may get low but shall never fail; it never has yet, although
it has been as low as it could be.&nbsp; I beg the Lord to
strengthen our faith, encourage hope, and draw forth
love:&mdash;these graces have to do with Christ, and the
Father&rsquo;s love to us in him.</p>
<p>It is truly lamentable that the Lord&rsquo;s children in the
present day, are resting so short of their precious privileges;
they have not attained, nor are they pressing on to know what
might be known, even the promise of the Father, in the more
abundant out-pouring of the Spirit: this is a blessing worth
waiting and hoping for; for we, through the Spirit, wait for the
hope of righteousness, by faith: and this is what the Apostle
Paul prays the Ephesians may be favored with.&mdash;See the 1st.
chapter of Eph. from verse 16th to the close; and in the same
Epistle he prays, also, that the saints might be so enlarged in
soul, as to come up to the attainments of the most eminent
saints, and know, and enjoy, the love of the adorable
Trinity.&mdash;This is a spiritual baptism, of which the outward
is only a sign&mdash;it is to be admitted into the most holy
views of, and communion with, God, in his three-fold character of
persons, in his decrees, purposes, and covenants, in his eternal
transactions, and the outgoings of his love, the glories of
Christ&rsquo;s person, and the everlasting perfection of his
work.&nbsp; These grand subjects are food for faith, these
nourish faith, and lead us to establishment and solid peace, that
neither sin, law, nor Satan can disturb.</p>
<p><a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>I
trust you go to hear some one who is calculated to feed the
soul.&nbsp; As for myself I am often low, yet contented at times
with the lowest form in the school of Jesus.&nbsp; I hope your
dear partner in life is led on amidst all conflicts, trials and
plagues&mdash;blessed is she that believeth, and I trust dear
Mrs. F. is long brought to that.&nbsp; Faith centers in Jesus,
and gathers strength in every trial; it will be victorious by and
bye.&nbsp; The victory which Jesus has gained is given to us by
the Father, and it is the work of the Spirit to manifest it with
some power.</p>
<p>I have no news to send about myself&mdash;if the Lord wanted
me to carry him into Jerusalem he would send word that I must be
loosed now, for the Lord hath need of him.&mdash;God be with you

<p><span class="smcap">Grace</span> and mercy be with
you.&mdash;I hope you are well in health and spirits, and, above
all, that the Lord is with you.&nbsp; I wish you felt grateful
for what he has done for you: it is well to look back to the days
of our ignorance; for although we know but little yet, still the
Lord might have left us to know <a name="page171"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 171</span>nothing; but is written, All thy
children are taught of God; and if we belong to the election of
graces we are taught by the Father.&nbsp; There are two things we
are sure to learn of the Father; we learn our own depravity and
condemnation by the law, that we deserve nothing at the hands of
God, but his wrath, because we have sinned against him; and we
learn of him the value of Christ, as he is revealed in the
word.&nbsp; We learn the record that God has given us of his Son,
that he is just such a Saviour as we need; for being condemned we
need a surety to pay our debts, a better righteousness to appear
in, before God, and we need an atonement to take away all our
sins&mdash;Christ has done it, and he is now in heaven pleading
our cause, representing us before God, and answering all the
charges that can be brought against us by Law, by Satan, or by
conscience.&nbsp; His blood and obedience, his holy nature, holy
life, and agonizing death, is our everlasting cure.&nbsp; This is
so precious to the Father, that he accepts all that come to him
in his dear Son&rsquo;s name, and pleading his work; he will
never send them away, cast them out, or give them up to Satan;
this is our mercy; none that trust in him shall be desolate,
forsaken, lost, condemned, or damned&mdash;Selah.</p>
<p>You have many trials, but they are most divinely appointed to
produce the fruits of righteousness, to exercise faith and
patience, to empty us of the love of sin and the world, to shew
us our weakness, and the daily need we have of Christ, as our
strength, our wisdom, and our deliverer.&nbsp; Christ is our
support, our strength, and our help, till he works a deliverance
for us.&nbsp; I am learning this, that I may explain it to
others; I talked about these things, and felt them in a degree,
but <i>now</i> <a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
172</span>I know them deeper than I once did; the Lord has
instructed me with a strong hand, and I long to speak these
things to others, yet a sense of my unworthiness keeps me back
from thinking even about it.&nbsp; I want the Lord&rsquo;s
children to trace up these mercies and trials to an everlasting
covenant, where they were provided; and it is very blessed to
remember, that all flows in love to us, and were divinely
appointed for us in infinite wisdom&mdash;the Lord is author of
all our mercies, he is not the author of our sins; he permits
them, and he over-rules them, according to his own plans, which
he laid out in eternity, but he did not begin them, he does not
force us to them, and it would be wicked to suppose it: the Lord
foresaw them, and he could have prevented them, but he had some
grand ends to answer by them.&nbsp; He decreed to glorify his
justice, his mercy, and his grace by them.&nbsp; So it is the
case with all our trials now, they are all laid out in number,
weight, and measure, and they will terminate well; they will
bring glory to God, and magnify the riches of his free grace.</p>
<p>I wish my dear Friend felt much of a spirit of grace and
supplication.&nbsp; Our conflicts are designed for this very end,
to stir us up to prayer, and reading the word: just like a person
of property, who feels he is in want of money, and searches his
Father&rsquo;s will to see where his property lies.&nbsp; This is
our case&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Sometimes my Lord his face doth hide,<br />
To make me pray, or kill my pride.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the design we are ready to suppose, when all things
run against us, that God is against us; but it is quite the
contrary, God is not at war with us, but against some of his and
our enemies, within us: this <a name="page173"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 173</span>is the reason why he contends with
us, to empty us of self, to bring us to live upon Christ, as our
all in all, that we may die daily to self and the world; and thus
in due time, live a life of faith upon Christ.&nbsp; We all want
to live a life of sense, but the Lord will be trusted in the
dark, as well as followed in the light, and we must be brought to
this point, if we wish to honour God&mdash;but we want to live on
frames and feelings, to walk in sunshine and good roads; but this
cannot be called trusting in him.&nbsp; There are many very
precious promises made to those who trust in him, and these we
should lose, if we were not led into this path.</p>
<p>I trust dear Mr. B. is well&mdash;my christian respects to
him: tell him I hope the Lord will lead his mind to Christ as his
Saviour, and hope God will bless you both, and all who are dear
to you.&mdash;Many thanks for your concern for</p>

<p>Mr. &amp; Mrs. <span class="smcap">Shephard</span>.</p>
<p><span class="GutSmall">MY DEAR FRIENDS</span>,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Grace</span> and peace be with
you.&mdash;This is what the Apostles wished the Church of God, in
all their Epistles, to which they often subjoined mercy.&nbsp;
What these three epithets imply, I and you must die to know, the
adorable Trinity purposing to set his love on man and <a
name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>on
angels&mdash;it was love indeed, as it flowed from the heart of
God.&nbsp; It is love, but it being set on some, and not on
others; some are elect angels, some are not; some are elect men,
some are not; and this love being so distinguished, is grace, or
free favour; and this favour manifested to us as fallen, guilty,
hell-deserving creatures, is mercy.&nbsp; I wish you to make
these distinctions, as they will open many blessed texts and
doctrines of the word.&nbsp; Now as grace and mercy flows to us
so divinely, this brings peace indeed, and in fact.&nbsp; These
three terms at once, include the gracious covenant work of the
ever adorable Trinity: the Father is the God of all grace, the
ever blessed Spirit is the mercy that saves us, and Christ is our
peace.&nbsp; And these terms also set forth the three-fold
offices of the ever blessed Jesus&mdash;he is merciful, as our
Prophet, gracious, as our Priest, and peaceable, as our
king.&nbsp; And is there not another sweet idea occurs to the
mind in experience, the influences of the Spirit are gracious;
these teach us to see our misery, and help us to cry for mercy;
and mercy seen and felt in pardoning sin, produces peace, thus
grace, mercy, and peace are with us.</p>
<p>There was something you said to me at the place, which gave me
very great pleasure, in reference to yourself, and from which I
gathered a hope you was growing in the knowledge of God our
Saviour.&nbsp; This is life eternal to know him, and it is a very
great favour indeed to be growing in that knowledge; many of the
Lord&rsquo;s children are grieved that they cannot get better,
nor grow into a good opinion of themselves.&nbsp; Hence they are
not pleased with themselves, and cast down because they appear so
bad to themselves, whereas our main concern should be to get
better acquainted with Christ, <a name="page175"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 175</span>as he is revealed in the gospel,
carrying on the great work of salvation.&nbsp; You and I must
lament, that when God&rsquo;s children meet together, even in
their most serious moments, they spend all their time in talking
about their frames, and feelings, instead of Christ; whereas,
talking about Jesus, and striving to get some sweet ideas of him,
as he is set forth in the word, and communicating those ideas,
would be the best subject, to improve the mind, warm the heart,
and lead out the soul to love Christ, and one another.&nbsp; This
would be the communion of saints, as connected with the
forgiveness of sins.&nbsp; Poor, tried saints are always talking
about their feelings; and common professors are talking about
this religious society, and the other, and thus they are well
pleased with what they do for God, before God has done any thing
for them: There is no communion in all this, &rsquo;tis a mere
bubble, and a plan of Satan&rsquo;s, to keep Christ out of the
mind.&nbsp; Christ is all in heaven, and he should be all in the
Church; and when he is all in all to us, we have got the sweetest
evidence that we can have, that we belong to God.&nbsp; I am
sometimes cast down in soul, but the Lord raises me up again; and
although the work of God is genuine on the soul, yet I find, by
repeated experience, that I can neither love, believe, or hope,
but as the blessed Spirit operates on the soul.&nbsp; Without
Christ we can do nothing, no more than a body without a head, or
limb cut off the body, or sick man without a physician, or an
accused man without a counsellor, or a condemned man without a
pardon.&nbsp; Christ is our Lord, physician, advocate, and
atonement, our righteousness and strength; and it is our mercy he
is the balm in Gilead, health amongst the witnesses, and the
healer there.&nbsp; Gilead signifies witnesses: these are the
Bible, and in <a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
176</span>the Church, and, blessed be God, in our hearts; also as
there are many things there can witness for him.&nbsp; Hence God
says, Ye are my witnesses, and my servant, whom I have
chosen.&nbsp; Christ was God&rsquo;s witness to us, and we are
witnesses of the freeness of his grace, and the value of his
blood.&nbsp; Christ represents us to God and we represent
Christ&mdash;he is God-Man in one.&nbsp; Man ruined himself in
aspiring to be God, and God saves man by becoming man; the
divinity is espoused to our nature, that our souls might be
espoused to Christ, and to God in him.&nbsp; The adorable Father
and eternal Spirit aims at the exaltation of Christ, as God-Man,
and all things are made for this purpose.</p>

<h2>LETTER L.</h2>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Achor&rsquo;s Vale</i>,
<i>October</i> 26th, 1819.</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fossett</span>.</p>
<p><span class="GutSmall">MY DEAR FRIEND AND BROTHER</span>,</p>
<p>When the chastising hand of God is laid heavily upon a nation,
a family, an individual, or a church, it <a
name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>becomes the
afflicted to ask, Is there not cause?&nbsp; When the troubles
abounded on pious Job, he said unto God, Shew me wherefore thou
contendest with me? and when the Lord made a breach upon Uzzah,
the reason is assigned, no doubt as an answer to some enquiring
souls, who were deeply affected with the Lord&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp;
David finding the cause of the breach was that of acting contrary
to the orders which had been previously given, in reference to
the persons bearing the ark (1 Chronicles, xv, 13) The Lord our
God made a breach upon us, for that we did not seek him after the
due order.&nbsp; And it is an awful circumstance recorded in the
New Testament, that, the sad disorders and conduct of the Church
at Corinth, was resented by the great Head of the Church on many
of its members (see 1 Cor. xi, 30).&nbsp; It has pleased the Lord
to make an awful breach amongst us, as a Church; the removal and
long reproach of your minister, the troubles and disgrace of the
congregation, the affliction of mind, body, and circumstances of
the Church at large, must be viewed as the rod of a Father,
chastising and correcting, reproving and calling to
consideration.&nbsp; As an individual, I trust the Lord has
convinced me of the sad occasion of these afflictions, and having
granted me the assurance of his pardoning mercy, I feel it my
duty to call the attention and exertion of the deacons and
managers, the church and congregation, to lay this important
matter to heart; and knowing the cause, to endeavour to remove
it.&nbsp; The Lord Jesus is jealous of his honour, and whatever
sullies or tarnishes that glory, he will resent it in some way or
other.</p>
<p>It has been a source of grief to many pious, grace-taught, and
conscientious persons, that there is so <a
name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>great a
neglect of the order of the gospel amongst us, as professing to
believe in, and love the Lard Jesus, by the teaching of his
Spirit&mdash;permit me to say, that this is a reason why the Lord
has thus so deeply afflicted us.&nbsp; I have been constantly
preaching the word, as far as I was taught, and helped, to the
Lord&rsquo;s people amongst us, for some years: God has given his
testimony to the word of his grace, and there has been an
assembling in his house, a submission to the ordinance of
baptism, by the majority, and a constant attendance at the
Lord&rsquo;s table.&nbsp; This was well as far as it went; but it
is necessary to stand complete in the <i>whole</i> will of God,
and to act in <i>all</i> things, consistent with the rules laid
down in his word.&nbsp; The precepts of the New Testament are the
laws of Christ, as king in Zion, and they must form our rule of
conduct in the Church, and in the world.&nbsp; A wilful neglect
of this rule, is an insult upon the Saviour, and he will resent
such conduct in his own People.&nbsp; Let us therefore search and
try our ways, and turn again unto the Lord.</p>
<p>I have frequently endeavored to rectify the error into which
we have fallen, viz. The neglect of Church order.&nbsp; Some
years ago, I published a pamphlet, entitled &ldquo;The Nature of
a Gospel Church,&rdquo; with the covenant into which all the
members were to enter, upon their admission to the Lord&rsquo;s
table.&nbsp; But, alas! this has scarcely ever been noticed
since: it was approved of, but never practised.&nbsp; I hope, at
a future day, to revise that little book, and add the following
Articles, which appear to me to be important, to the founding and
establishing the Church in future, and for the glory of the
Saviour; but till we are settled again, as a congregation, I take
this opportunity of sending <a name="page179"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 179</span>you what I humbly conceive to be the
Spirit&rsquo;s mind, concerning the well-being of the Church of
Christ.&nbsp; These Articles, I pray the God of all grace, to
enable us constantly to observe, with the rules laid down in the
members covenant, and the confession of faith there
published.</p>
<p>The Articles, I hope, will be punctually attended to.&nbsp; I
know your concern of mind on this subject, and have no doubt, by
prayer and perseverance, but the Lord will succeed our humble
attempt to glorify his holy name.&mdash;Christian love to Mrs.
F.</p>

and good moral characters, and who are Baptists, both in
Principle and Practice.</p>
<p>2.&mdash;That the Deacons shall be chosen by Lot, or by a
Majority of the Members, at a public Meeting of the Church, when
every Member shall be entitled to a Vote, except those who are
under Church censure: such cannot be admitted to vote, till fully
restored.</p>
<p>3.&mdash;That the Minister shall make it a particular point of
conscience, to point out the work of Deacons, in the faithful
discharge of their office.</p>
<p>4.&mdash;That the Minister and Deacons shall be reproved by
the Church, for any inconsistency of conduct, or a deviation from
any of the fundamental doctrines of the gospel; and should either
Minister or Deacons continue to persist in such practises, or
errors, they must be suspended, should a majority of the Church
so determine,</p>
<p>5.&mdash;Should any of the Members act in any unjustifiable
way to the Minister, such shall be reproved; and if they continue
such conduct, the Church shall expel them.</p>
<p>6.&mdash;That the Minister is to have but one voice in the
Church, on any occasion whatever.</p>
<p>7.&mdash;That the Church meet once a month, at which the
Minister, if possible, is to be always present, and the Deacons
also to make it a point of conscience to attend <i>all</i> the
public and private meetings of the Church and Congregation, as
far as they are able.</p>
<p><a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
182</span>8.&mdash;That the Church Meetings shall always be

Testament, setting forth the Duty of Church Members.</p>
<p>9.&mdash;That the Minister shall have the privilege to call
the Church together on any special occasion.</p>
<p>10.&mdash;That no Minister be suffered to go into the Pulpit

to manage all the temporal affairs of the Church, and appoint one
of the Members once a year, to act as Secretary to them, and
report the state of the temporal affairs of the Chapel to the
Church.</p>
<p>12.&mdash;That the particular Affairs of the Church shall not
be disclosed to those who have no connection with us; and any
unpleasant circumstances which may arise in the Church, or
concerning any Member, shall not be exposed to the
world&mdash;and all Admonitions to offending Persons shall be
kept from general observation.</p>
<p>13.&mdash;That a Book or Books shall be kept to record the
names of the Members, and every important transaction in the
Church.</p>
<p>14.&mdash;That no Person acting as a Servant in the Church
shall hold more than one Office, except by particular
request.</p>
<p>15.&mdash;That no Member be allowed to bring any grievance of
a temporal nature, before the Church, till it has obtained the
Consent of the Minister and Deacons.</p>
<p><a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
183</span>16.&mdash;That the Ordinance of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper
be duly administered every first Lord&rsquo;s Day in the month,
in the Evening, and on particular occasions, when the Minister
shall appoint.</p>
<p>17.&mdash;That when a Person desires to unite with the Church,
to break Bread, and to partake of the various Privileges of the
Lord&rsquo;s House, they are to intimate the same to the Minister
or to the Deacons, or to any Member to introduce them.</p>
<p>18.&mdash;That the Deacons are to enquire into the state of
their souls, respecting a Work of Grace, and if they are
satisfied, the Candidate is to be brought to the Minister, who is
to propose them to the Church at the earliest Meeting
thereof.&nbsp; This Examination is to be in a very faithful, yet
candid and affectionate manner.&nbsp; The Deacons are also to
take the earliest opportunity of minutely enquiring into the
moral Character and Conduct of such Persons, and upon approbation
the Candidate must attend at the next Church Meeting.</p>
<p>19.&mdash;That Persons wishing to be admitted be also
requested to relate to the Church the dealings of God with their
souls; but, if timid, they may give in a written account of the
same, or the Minister to ask them such questions as relate to the
subject; and upon the Candidate&rsquo;s retirement, the Deacons
are to give an account of the report of their moral conduct, and
if there is a majority of Votes, they shall be immediately
admitted as Members of the Church.</p>
<p>20.&mdash;That if such Persons are not baptized by immersion,
the subject is to be particularly explained to them by the
Deacons and Members of the Church, as they have opportunity, but
they are not to be admitted to the Lordly Table till the subject
is opened to them.</p>
<p><a name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
184</span>21.&mdash;That any desirous of Baptism, are to signify
the same as early as possible to the Deacons, or Minister, that,
when there is a convenient number, they may partake of that
ordinance.&nbsp; Not less than twelve persons, unless under very
peculiar circumstances.&nbsp; And if it be signified, privately,
that any Person or Persons are not able to bear the usual expence
attending the ordinance, the Church is to bear that expence, as
on those occasions there is much damage done to the Chapel.</p>
<p>22.&mdash;That the baptized Persons, and all those who were
admitted as Members at the Church Meeting, shall be publicly
received at the ordinance of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper, when the
Articles of Faith shall be read to them, an address be given
them, with singing and prayer, when they are to receive the right
hand of fellowship from the Minister, the representative of the
Church.</p>
<p>23.&mdash;That the Minister and Deacons shall enforce the
various Duties of Church Members, and stir each other up to every
good word and work.&nbsp; That they shall sympathize with each
other; study each other&rsquo;s spiritual and temporal
welfare&mdash;that they shall deal and trade with each other, as
much as their circumstances will admit, in preference to any
other, as Children of the same Father.&nbsp; That they warn the
unruly, instruct the ignorant, comfort the feeble-minded; give
timely, kind, affectionate, but <i>faithful</i> reproof, when
needed; restore the Backslider, and endeavour to promote the
prosperity and peace of the Church.&nbsp; But if any Member
persists in walking inconsistently, such shall be admonished by
the Minister and Deacons; but if this has no avail, the Church
shall be informed of it, and if no reproof has had any effect,
such offender shall be cut off, till some signs of penitence and
reformation appear, when, if it be desired, such Person shall be
re-admitted.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
